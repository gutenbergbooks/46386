<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the biggest lake there is chooses to
go on one of her very best rampages, even
the bravest of mariners make as speedily as
possible for safe harbors. At midnight, therefore,
following a certain blustery day in early
summer, it was not strange that the huge,
storm-tossed lake appeared, for as far as eye
could reach, absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>Somewhere, however, on that fearfully tumultuous
sea, one direly threatened craft was
still abroad, and, what is a greater marvel, still
afloat. At best, the ancient yawl was but a
poor excuse for a ship; now, at her worst,
she was little more than a raft. Driven before
the wind, tossed here and there by the buffeting
waves, she carried a solitary passenger
and only a little one at that.</p>

<p>Indeed, he wasn't at all the kind of sailor
that one would <i>expect</i> to find sailing dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
seas all alone at midnight, for the solitary
mariner, adrift in all that wilderness of tumbling
water, was a twelve-year-old boy.</p>

<p>There was no sail to the little boat&mdash;that
had been torn away in the furious gale&mdash;but
a short, stumpy mast remained. To that the
boy, happily unconscious of his plight, was
firmly but rather clumsily bound by means of
many folds of stout fish-net wrapped tightly
about his slender body. Also about his waist
hung a battered life-preserver.</p>

<p>The lad had been fastened there by other
hands than his own, for most of the knots
were out of his reach. The little chap's head
hung forward; his eyes were closed; he no
longer heard the roar of the sea or felt the
cold or suffered from hunger; but in spite
of this merciful oblivion, he still had a life
to lose&mdash;and was in very grave danger of
losing it.</p>

<p>It isn't fair, of course, to leave a really attractive
little lad in a plight like this; with
darkness and an angry sea all about him; with,
seemingly no possible help at hand, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
nearest coast was still many miles distant and
supposedly uninhabited.</p>

<p>Yet, in this truly terrible predicament, this
poor boy&mdash;strange little hero of a girls' story&mdash;must
remain until you've learned just how
a certain "Whale" (you must admit that it
isn't usual to find whales near fresh water)
contributed to his rescue.</p>

<p>To discover exactly how it all happened we
must go way back to the very beginning; and
the beginning of it all was Bettie.</p>

PATCH</div>




<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>An Innocent Plan</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"THIS," said Bettie Tucker, one morning,
with approving glances at the offerings
heaped about her, "is certainly a pretty
fine world. I'm glad I stayed in it, even if I
haven't feet enough for eleven pairs of pink
bed socks."</p>

<p>For an alarming number of weeks, Bettie's
friends had feared that this most lovable of
little girls might <i>not</i> remain in it; but now
that all danger was past, she was able to sit
for long hours by the window that afforded
the best view of the Tuckers' front gate.</p>

<p>Ordinarily it was not much of a gate. So
many little Tuckers had climbed upon it and
tumbled off that it had grown shaky as to
hinges and bald as to paint; though, if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
used rope enough, it was still useful as a barrier
between the world and the adventuresome
Tucker babies.</p>

<p>But now this gate&mdash;or rather this gateway&mdash;had
become a most interesting spot.
Through it, at delightfully frequent intervals,
came baskets, boxes, and bundles. Most of
them contained offerings, more or less enjoyable,
for convalescent Bettie; for all the members
of Doctor Tucker's church loved the gentle,
kindly, absent-minded clergyman. Now
that a member of his household was recovering
from a serious illness, it seemed, as Doctor
Bennett, the family physician said, as if the
parish were bent on making her ill again by
sending her more things to eat than any one
small Bettie-girl could possibly hold. Everything
from soup to dessert flowed in at that
gate, for Lakeville was a kindly town and
everybody knew that overworked Mrs. Tucker
had quite enough to do without the extra work
of preparing dainty food.</p>

<p>Moreover, to add very seriously to Bettie's
danger from promiscuous donations, Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Bennett's own warm-hearted but decidedly inexperienced
young daughter Mabel was laboriously
cooking things out of a large number of
cook-books to carry triumphantly or despondently,
according to her degree of success, to
her very dearest friend Bettie.</p>

<p>"This," explained Mabel, one morning, displaying
a dull purple, most uninviting object
that quivered uncannily when one shook the
bowl, "is 'Ambrosial Delight.'"</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where did you get it?" asked
Bettie, eying the strange mixture distrustfully.</p>

<p>"Out of an advertising cook-book that
somebody left on our doorstep. It said 'Ambrosial
Delight' under the picture, but someway
the pudding looks&mdash;different."</p>

<p>"What makes it such a very queer color?"
demanded interested Bettie.</p>

<p>"Grape juice and eggs," explained Mabel,
tenderly clasping her handiwork to her breast.
"You see, according to the picture, it ought
to be in even purple and yellow stripes and
standing up in a stiff para&mdash;parachute&mdash;those
things in Egypt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pyramid. Go on," assisted Bettie, accustomed
to Mabel's difficulties of speech.</p>

<p>"Pyramid, but someway the custard part
and the jelly part all ran together and sat
down. But it tastes a lot better than it looks."</p>

<p>"Bettie mustn't eat anything more for two
hours," interposed Mrs. Tucker. "She's just
had a big piece of strawberry shortcake. I'll
set this pudding in the ice-box&mdash;that'll harden
the jelly."</p>

<p>"I'm ever so much obliged," beamed Bettie,
suspecting that Mabel would have enjoyed seeing
her eat the "Ambrosial Delight." "It's
nice of you to cook things for me."</p>

<p>"Even if they do turn out wrong most every
time," supplemented Mabel. "Yes, I think it
is nice, because I sort of hate to cook anyway,
and everybody in our house just hates to have
me. I'm so untidy, they say. I always have
to do it when Bridget isn't looking and it
makes me nervous to have to hurry. Can you
think of anything else you'd like me to make?"
continued this martyr. "Because I'd <i>do</i> it, if
I had to get up before daylight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know of anything unless somebody
invents a dish that will go right straight to
my knees. They wabble. I feel as if I'd like
to run a mile, but by the time I've tottered
to the gate I'm glad it isn't more than a dozen
steps. There's your father coming&mdash;I'm going
to ask him why my knees wabble so
awfully."</p>

<p>Impulsive Mabel, at this news, instinctively
scrambled under the bed. Then, remembering
that she had really been pretty good all day,
she sheepishly crawled out, to Bettie's amusement,
to greet her surprised father.</p>

<p>"I'm on my way home," said she.</p>

<p>"So I notice," returned Doctor Bennett, his
mouth stern, his eyes twinkling. "Don't let
me detain you."</p>

<p>"I want to know," demanded Bettie, "why
I haven't any knees?"</p>

<p>"I think," replied Doctor Bennett, "that
we ought to get you outdoors a great deal
more than we do. You're not getting air
enough. Where's your jacket? I'll take you
for a drive this minute&mdash;I'm going to South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Lakeville by the shore road to see a patient.
Think you're good for a buggy ride?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," laughed Bettie, "but I'm
afraid my bones will scratch all the varnish
off your nice bright buggy. I've twice as many
ribs as I used to have&mdash;perhaps my knees have
turned into ribs!"</p>

<p>Bettie returned an hour later; none the
worse for her drive and hungry enough to eat
even Mabel's unsightly pudding, after finishing
a large bowl of broth.</p>

<p>"It tastes fine," she confided to Doctor Bennett,
who had insisted on carrying the slender
invalid upstairs, "if you eat it with your eyes
shut. My! I'm hungry as a bear&mdash;wasn't it
lucky that mother had my lunch ready?"</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have to have another ride
to-morrow," laughed the pleased doctor.
"Fresh air is all the medicine you need&mdash;you
ought to <i>live</i> outdoors."</p>

<p>There was danger, however, of Bettie's getting
more fresh air than any one little maid
could ever hope to breathe, for, the next morning,
there was an item in Lakeville's daily paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that brought curious and almost instantaneous
results. The paragraph read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Miss Bettie Tucker, who has been seriously
ill for several weeks, enjoyed her first outing
yesterday."</p></blockquote>

<p>It wasn't a very big item, Bettie thought,
for so momentous an event, but it was quite
large enough for kind-hearted Lakeville. Immediately,
everybody with anything one <i>could</i>
ride in wanted to take Bettie driving. Mr.
Black placed his automobile at her disposal.
Henrietta Bedford's grandmother, Mrs. Slater,
laid her horses, the grandest of her carriages,
and her only coachman at Bettie's bedroom-slippered
feet; Jean and Marjory laboriously
collected sufficient money to hire a sad
old horse, more or less attached to a dilapidated
cab, from the very cheapest livery stable
for a whole expensive hour. Nearly all the
members of Doctor Tucker's congregation took
turns inviting Bettie to ride in anything from
a buckboard to an omnibus. Even Julius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Muhlhauser, the milkman, insisted on carrying
her, in his flaming scarlet cart, over three-fourths
of his milk-route, one morning.</p>

<p>"That," laughed Bettie, after the milkman
had delivered her safely at her own door, "was
something different. It isn't everybody who
has a chance to drive down the milky way."</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" asked her mother, meeting
her at the door, with a bowl of broth.</p>

<p>"Not so very," returned Bettie, nevertheless
accepting the broth and eating it eagerly.
"I drank a whole pint of the milk-wagon
milk."</p>

<p>Next, all Bettie's friends began to invite the
little girl to visit them. She had to spend
whole days or pieces of days with Jean, with
Marjory, with Henrietta, with Mabel (who
nursed her so devotedly that she almost suffered
a relapse), and with Mrs. Crane and
Mr. Black. But, as yet, she had not returned
to her old footing with her comrades; she
was not yet sufficiently strong for the old
rough-and-tumble play, the happy-go-lucky
hours in Dandelion Cottage. She was a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
variety of Bettie, a fragile Bettie, to be handled
with the utmost tenderness.</p>

<p>Mr. Black and his stout sister, Mrs. Crane,
than whom Bettie had no stauncher friends,
had swung the largest and most gorgeous hammock
that Lakeville could furnish, under their
trees for her&mdash;they were only sorry that she
couldn't use <i>two</i> hammocks.</p>

<p>"Peter," said Mrs. Crane (they were sitting
on the porch to keep an eye on Bettie, who, in
spite of the gorgeousness of her swaying
couch, had fallen asleep), "that child ought
to stay outdoors all the time. That rectory
is a stuffy place, crowded up against the church
and right in the smoke of two factories. As
soon as she's strong enough to stand it, she
ought to go camping&mdash;some place on the lake
shore where the air is pure."</p>

<p>"Of course she ought," agreed Mr. Black,
heartily. "It's the best tonic in the world for
growing children&mdash;there's nothing like it in
bottles."</p>

<p>"Isn't there any way we could manage it?
If we only had a camp&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have one," promised Mr. Black,
promptly.</p>

<p>"But we haven't any land&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have; a lot of it. About four
years ago I bought forty acres from an Indian,
forty more from his brother, and then,
just to be obliging, forty more from his friend,
all for a few dollars an acre. Afterwards
somebody suggested that it was all the same
forty, but it wasn't; I looked it up to see. It's
seventeen miles from here on the shore of the
biggest and wettest lake there is, with the
cleanest, sweetest air that ever was made. Just
the finest spot in the world for a camp&mdash;I saw
it once.</p>

<p>"When? Oh, six or seven years ago. I
tell you what, Sarah! Suppose we take a run
up there in the automobile and have a look
at it. There used to be a road&mdash;it's probably
there yet."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't we make a picnic of it and
take Bettie and the girls?" asked good Mrs.
Crane, instantly falling in with her brother's
plan. "Seventeen miles is no distance at all for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the car&mdash;I'm sure Bettie could stand it because
she could get a nap there as well as at home."</p>

<p>"We could," agreed Mr. Black, "and I
guess there'd be room for Henrietta, too&mdash;she'll
want to go."</p>

<p>"I always did enjoy a picnic," confessed
Mrs. Crane, a little sheepishly. "I guess I
haven't quite grown up, in some ways."</p>

<p>"I like 'em myself," owned Mr. Black.
"Besides, I've been thinking for some time
that I'd like a look at that land&mdash;haven't seen
it since I bought it. This is Monday, isn't it?
Suppose we go there day after to-morrow if
the weather stays right&mdash;that'll give us a day
to cook in. We'll ask the girls to-night."</p>

<p>So, in this commonplace fashion, was
planned the picnic that proved utterly unlike
any picnic that this good, elderly couple had
ever attended; for this particular outing behaved
in a most extraordinary way. Mr.
Black supposed that this innocent excursion
was his, that it belonged to him, that it was
subservient to his will; instead of which&mdash;but
you shall hear what happened.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>The Troubled Whale</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MR. BLACK, his fine dark eyes sparkling
with pleasure; his crisp hair, plentifully
sprinkled with white, standing upright from
his broad, benevolent brow, looked with approval
at his party as he packed his merry
guests very carefully into his big touring car.</p>

<p>Jean, who was tall and not particularly wide
for her fourteen and a half years, was attractive
because of the serene loveliness of her
expression; one knew at a glance that she was
a <i>good</i> child. One guessed, just as quickly,
that Henrietta was sometimes naughty, for an
impish light danced in her long-lashed black
eyes and there was a mischievous dimple in
the dusky crimson of her cheek. Next to Jean
in height and age, she seemed older and yet
less responsible&mdash;one couldn't be quite sure of
spirited Henrietta Bedford.</p>

<p>Marjory, two years younger, was both short
and narrow for her age; and so very fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that one had to guess at her eyebrows. But
she, too, was a pretty child, for her small features
were pleasing and her pale golden hair
was quite wonderful. Like Henrietta, she was
quick and graceful in all her movements.</p>

<p>Bettie, also between twelve and thirteen, was
now mostly eyes; big, velvety brown ones that
played pranks with one's heart-strings; particularly
with those of Mr. Black and Mrs.
Crane. She had lost all her short, curly brown
hair during her illness; it was now coming in,
shorter and curlier than ever.</p>

<p>Mabel, the youngest of the group, was also
the broadest. But her undeniable plumpness
did not detract from her looks. One couldn't
help liking her honest brown eyes, the wholesome
red and white of her rounded countenance,
her sturdy, childlike figure, and the rich
bronze of her abundant&mdash;and frequently untidy&mdash;hair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane, brown as to skin, black as to
eyes, stout, elderly, and warm-hearted, was
very like her brother, except that she sometimes
worried. Mr. Black never did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally all these good people, with a coat or
sweater for each girl, with two big hampers
of food from Mr. Black's home, with several
baskets of picnic lunch from the other houses,
were stowed away in the capacious car. Mr.
Black called his automobile the "Whale," because
once, for a few weeks, it had been driven
by Jonah Higginsworth, who, however, was
so frequently cast forth by this modern whale,
owing to dangerously reckless driving, that
Mr. Black had been obliged to discharge him.</p>

<p>"We are seven," said Mr. Black, taking the
chauffeur's seat. "I'm going to drive this car
myself; they say the road's a bit rough&mdash;isn't
used much. Seven's a good number."</p>

<p>"Eight's better," retorted Henrietta, diving
into a silk bag and dragging forth a queer bundle
of mottled fur.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Mr. Black. "I
didn't invite anybody like that to <i>my</i> picnic."</p>

<p>"Just a kitten," explained Henrietta, waving
him for all to see. "I adopted him yesterday,
but nobody in our house likes him, so I
have to <i>wear</i> him&mdash;he's very tame."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"He looks," laughed Bettie, "just like the
pudding Mabel made for me two weeks ago;
purple, yellow, and white, all jumbled together&mdash;let's
name him Ambrosial Delight."</p>

<p>"No," objected Henrietta, "he's already
named Anthony Fitz-Hubert."</p>

<p>"Because he has fits?" asked Marjory.</p>

<p>"He <i>doesn't</i>. Just see how calm he is."</p>

<p>Doctor Bennett, Doctor Tucker, Marjory's
Aunty Jane, and all the mothers stood on the
sidewalk to see the merry party started on its
way. Henrietta's dignified little grandmother
sat in her carriage.</p>

<p>"Don't worry if we're late," said Mr. Black,
turning to this trusting assemblage and not
guessing how very late he was going to be.
"The other end of our road may prove a trifle
heavy; the day's so fine that we're not going
to hurry, anyhow. Good-by till you see us
again&mdash;we'll take the very best care of all your
precious girls. Good-by, good-by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just where are you going?" shrieked
Aunty Jane, a moment too late.</p>

<p>For the picnic, kitten and all, was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
spinning joyously away; and never was there
a happier party. At first the inviting road was
all that road should be, for constant use kept it
in excellent condition. After the first two
miles, however, the going was only fair, as it
was necessary to proceed rather slowly because
spring rains had uncovered big boulders that
it seemed best to avoid. Also there were
chickens&mdash;never had the Whale's way been so
beset by loitering hens. When these had
finally been left behind, the Whale came to a
pleasant stretch of country road partly overgrown
with short, fragrant grass.</p>

<p>"If it's all like this," said Mrs. Crane, sniffing
contentedly, "it won't take long to travel
seventeen miles."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't like that for any
great distance. Soon the Whale was panting
laboriously up a long, stony hill; down which
a foolish little creek that had strayed from
its proper bed was meandering aimlessly but
with most disastrous results. It had made deep,
jagged, treacherous furrows that had to be
skilfully avoided; so it took considerable time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to climb the damaged hill. After that, the road
was sandy.</p>

<p>The sand in northern Michigan seems sandier
than any other sand. Mr. Black was certain
that it was at least a mile deep along that
dreadful road, skirted by a dreary stretch of
small poplars. But far ahead, this dauntless
man could see the beckoning green of lofty
trees&mdash;he fixed hopeful eyes on that and
coaxed the groaning Whale to nobler efforts.
Where the sand was deepest, everybody but
Bettie and Mr. Black got out and walked&mdash;or
waded along the dusty roadside; and sometimes
they pushed the Whale when that weary
leviathan threatened to stick. At length, however,
the dusty car lurched heavily into the
grateful shade of a fine forest road, carpeted
smoothly with pine needles and the decaying
leaves of oak, maple, and elm trees, whose
branches, green and lovely with spring foliage,
met overhead.</p>

<p>"Oh," breathed Bettie, lying back luxuriously
among her cushions, "isn't this just
beautiful!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's go slowly," pleaded Mrs. Crane.
"It's years since I've seen such woods. I
declare! I'd like to stay right here."</p>

<p>"I guess the mosquitoes 'd be glad to have
you," said Mr. Black. "Are all those girls
aboard? They won't need to do any walking
as long as this lasts&mdash;it was <i>made</i> for the
Whale!"</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the beautifully smooth
ground stretched before them for only a few
precious moments, though the forest itself
grew wilder and more interesting at every turn
of the wheels. After a time, the road began
to dip steadily downward. Presently the
Whale was sliding over clay, pushing through
deep, clinging mire, splashing through puddles
of stagnant water, or bumping over stretches
of half-submerged corduroy.</p>

<p>"Peter," said Mrs. Crane, rather nervously,
when her patient, elderly brother had climbed
out for the fourth time to pull long ropes of
tangled weeds out of the wheels, "don't you
think we'd better give up and turn back? It's
getting worse and worse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," returned Mr. Black, "I don't. I
started out to look at that land and I'm going
to find it. Besides, Timothy Burbank drove
over this road this spring and he says it's open
all the way to Barclay's Point&mdash;my place is a
mile this side of Barclay's."</p>

<p>"But Timothy rode in a buckboard."</p>

<p>"He said he guessed the Whale could make
it and I've no reason to doubt his word. Anyhow,
we're going on&mdash;we're so muddy now
that a little more won't hurt us; and there's
one comfort; there are no steep precipices on
this road for us to tumble from."</p>

<p>It was fortunate, too, that Mr. Black carried
a hatchet, because several times it became
necessary to chop fallen trees&mdash;luckily they
were small ones&mdash;out of the road; and once it
was necessary to repair a broken bridge; but
the girls, who helped with that, thoroughly
enjoyed the task. Occasionally, the Whale
was obliged to ford a certain small river that
crossed the road an astonishing number of
times. Also, with increasing frequency, Mr.
Black was obliged to crawl under the car to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
see what was the matter with the machinery;
but, on the whole, the Whale behaved surprisingly
well.</p>

<p>Presently the road which, up to that moment,
had stretched mainly toward the north,
turned sharply toward the east.</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Mr. Black, with a deep
sigh of satisfaction. "Timothy says our place
is just three miles from this turn. Does anybody
want to go back <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>Nobody did, so the Whale pushed on; and,
wonder of wonders! For a whole delightful
mile the road was good, alluringly good. The
big car fairly pranced with pleasure, and all
the passengers settled back comfortably
against the cushions. But after that one deceiving
mile! Never was there a more discouraging
stretch of road&mdash;if it <i>were</i> road.
Sunken boulders, slime-covered water, deep
black mud, rotting corduroy, jutting logs,
weed-grown swamp. The Whale's passengers
were jounced and jolted, spattered and
scratched. Low-growing branches slapped
their faces and reached maliciously for unguarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
tresses. Altogether, this final two
miles of wilderness surpassed all the rest&mdash;suppose
there were no bottom to that mud!
Even Henrietta was too frightened for speech.</p>

<p>Finally the Whale, with a last despairing
gasp that died away to an alarming silence, refused
to go a single inch farther.</p>

<p>"It's all out for everybody," said Mr. Black,
who now looked as concerned as the others.
"Something's given out&mdash;it's not surprising."</p>

<p>"But," objected Mrs. Crane, "how are we
to get home?"</p>

<p>"Hush, woman," returned Mr. Black,
whimsically, "folks on their way <i>to</i> a picnic
don't talk about going home. Let's get there
first."</p>

<p>"Why!" cried light-footed Marjory, who
had darted ahead and back again with her
news, "we're out of that swamp, anyway.
This road goes right uphill and it's sandy."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Black. "That
means that we're almost there. Come back,
Marjory, and get your share of the load; everybody
must carry something. Bettie, can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
walk half a mile if you're helped over the
rough places?"</p>

<p>"A whole mile if I have to&mdash;I'm not tired."</p>

<p>"The air," remarked Jean, sniffing curiously,
when the party had reached the top of
the brief ascent, "smells different. My! Isn't
it good! I feel it way down inside of me."</p>

<p>"It's the lake," explained Mr. Black. "In
less than ten minutes you're going to see something."</p>

<p>The prediction proved true. In a very few
moments the road branched, the right fork led
them north, then swerved again toward the
east, the forest stopped with a suddenness that
was startling, and the picnic found itself in
a wide, grassy clearing at the very edge of
the big, blue lake. The bigness and the blueness
were dazzling. The curved beach
stretched like a broad golden ribbon in either
direction.</p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Black, "is the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter!" cried Mrs. Crane, dropping
her end of the heaviest hamper. "How much
of it is ours?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every scrap. All that you can see."</p>

<p>"What! Down to that rocky point?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and up the other way to that other
rocky point&mdash;a whole mile of shore line."</p>

<p>"And the island off that little projection&mdash;is
<i>that</i> ours?"</p>

<p>"Every inch of it."</p>

<p>"Why, Peter!"</p>

<p>"Fine, isn't it? We own a river, too&mdash;there's
the mouth of it down the shore. What
do you think of it all, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Peter, it's&mdash;it's heaven!"</p>

<p>"And uninhabited," declared Mr. Black,
supposing that he was speaking the exact truth,
"except for our seven selves."</p>

<p>There was, however, an eighth inhabitant;
and a human one at that. But for the time
being no one suspected it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>A Predicament</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"PETER," queried Mrs. Crane, "what
time is it? I'm starved."</p>

<p>Mr. Black looked at his watch, at first expectantly,
then ruefully.</p>

<p>"The thing's stopped," said he, shaking it.
"I dropped it out a couple of times when I
was under the Whale, and once it struck a
boulder. It stopped at half-past twelve."</p>

<p>"An hour ago?"</p>

<p>"It <i>might</i> be two hours&mdash;or even three!
Girls, did you bring a watch&mdash;any of you?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Henrietta, "but I wound it
to practise by without setting it, so it's probably
wrong&mdash;it usually is. It says quarter to nine!"</p>

<p>"It certainly <i>is</i> wrong. I <i>know</i> it's dinner
time&mdash;or worse. Sarah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Build a fire, Peter&mdash;there's plenty of wood
on the beach. I brought a coffee pot and you'll
find a box of matches in it. Jean, spread the
cloth that's in one of those hampers&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ground's nice and smooth right there at your
feet. You'll find wooden plates and tin cups
under the cloth. Marjory, you can fish for
the sugar and cream and the salad. Mabel,
you&mdash;no, I'll cut the bread myself; you can
pick up bits of wood for the fire."</p>

<p>"There are two big apple pies and some
cheese in my basket," said Jean, "and&mdash;yes, a
bag of cookies!"</p>

<p>"Here are my sandwiches," said Henrietta.
"Just loads of them; and a big veal loaf&mdash;&mdash; Oh!
It smells so good!"</p>

<p>"Aunty Jane sent a huge crock of beans and
some cold ham," said Marjory, "and here's
a jar of something&mdash;pickles, I guess."</p>

<p>"There's a box of things," said Mr. Black,
"fruit, cookies, crackers, sardines, peanut butter,
and a thing or two in cans still aboard the
Whale, but I guess, with all this good home
cooking, we won't need it just yet&mdash;anyway,
I'd rather look at the lake than go after it."</p>

<p>"Can't I take off my shoes and wade out
for the coffee water?" pleaded Mabel. "I
love to wade."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you can," replied Mrs. Crane.
"Here's the pail&mdash;I'll take the doughnuts out
of it."</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked Mr. Black, holding
up a flat, heavy parcel.</p>

<p>"A piece of bacon&mdash;I thought we might
need bacon and eggs in addition to our salad&mdash;I
brought a flat pan to fry them in. And
here are salt and pepper."</p>

<p>"Well!" laughed Mr. Black, as parcel after
parcel came out of the tightly packed hampers,
"I guess we'll have to set up a grocery store
and sell stuff to the squirrels&mdash;we can't possibly
eat all this at <i>one</i> meal."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure," warned Bettie. "I'm
pretty hungry. Mother put in a can of cocoa
and a little saucepan to cook it in&mdash;and here's
a pint of milk."</p>

<p>"We'll make the cocoa and coffee," decided
Mrs. Crane, "and eat the sandwiches
and other ready-made things. We won't
bother to do any other cooking; and, I must
say, I'm glad we don't need to. I <i>never</i> was
so hungry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody it seemed was on the verge of
starvation. The Whale's passengers ate and
ate and ate. Even Ambrosial Delight, the
three-colored cat, drank milk as if he had always
lived on the lake shore and dined from
wooden plates. After dinner, every one, except
Bettie, who was compelled by solicitous
Mrs. Crane to curl up with the kitten under
a tree for a nap, went exploring.</p>

<p>That was great fun, for exploring is interesting,
anyway, even if you haven't anything
bigger to explore than your own back yard.
But when you have a whole wilderness, with
a little of every kind of landscape there is
dotted about, here and there; and always so
unexpectedly that you don't know what you're
coming to next, exploring becomes just the
very jolliest pursuit there is.</p>

<p>In the first place, there was the large, grassy
clearing where they had eaten dinner. This
place was almost circular in shape and as big,
Bettie said, as a whole city block. In it were
a few scattered trees; but, for the greater part,
it was open and almost perfectly level. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one side was the lake; the other three sides
were walled in by most attractive forest.</p>

<p>A number of little trails led from the clearing
into the woods. Each one, they found,
pointed toward some definite object. One, for
instance, carried them to a tiny spring of clear,
gurgling water. Another led them to what was
evidently a good fishing spot on the river. A
third brought them to a tiny unsuspected lake,
dotted with lily pads.</p>

<p>"This," said quick-eyed Marjory, pointing
northwestward, when the explorers had returned
for the third time to the sunny clearing,
"is the widest trail of all."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Mr. Black, "I don't
know why there should be any trails here at
all. No one has lived here for four years.
Sometimes fishermen come here in gasoline
launches for a few days in the spring, or hunters
for a week or two in the fall, but never
in sufficient numbers to make as marked a trail
as this&mdash;we must certainly investigate <i>this</i>
one."</p>

<p>This wider trail led them for perhaps a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
feet through a dense thicket of shrubbery;
then, with a suddenness that was startling,
the explorers found themselves in another
clearing, about half the size of the first.
In it stood a curious structure with a rounded
top. It was built of bent strips of wood, covered
with large sheets of rough birch bark,
bound in place with willow withes, and sewed
in spots with buckskin thongs. It was blackened
with age and smoke.</p>

<p>"It looks," said Henrietta, "like the top
half of a big balloon. And mercy! How horrible
it smells."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> it?" asked Mabel. "Is it a bear's
den? Ugh! I hope Mr. Bear isn't home."</p>

<p>"It's a birch-bark wigwam," replied Mr.
Black, "and somebody has occupied it recently.
See the bed in the corner?"</p>

<p>Sure enough, there <i>was</i> a bed&mdash;some balsam
boughs covered with a dingy blanket and some
rags that had once been a quilt. On an upturned
box was a burlap bag containing potatoes
and a few perfectly sound onions. A
deer-skin was stretched to dry against one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
rounded side of the wigwam and just opposite
the doorway of the queer hut were a number
of blackened stones, evidently a rude fireplace.
Hanging against a convenient tree-trunk were
some sooty and most uninviting cooking utensils;
a camp kettle, a frying-pan, a lard pail
or two, a big iron pot, a long-handled spoon.</p>

<p>"It isn't a great while," said Mr. Black,
frowning perplexedly, "since these things were
used. But who, I'd like to know, used them?"</p>

<p>"Wild Indians," offered Marjory, glancing
fearfully over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Pirates," shuddered Mabel.</p>

<p>"A wild man of the jungle," suggested imaginative
Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're all partly right," admitted
Mr. Black. "I believe these things belong to a
filthy half-breed, trapping game out of season.
If <i>I</i> catch him at it, it will be some time
before he has a chance to try it again. Perhaps
he'll come back this afternoon. Now,
girls, let's go back to the lake&mdash;this place certainly
does smell 'injun-y'&mdash;there's no other
smell quite like it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't we all go in wading?" demanded
Mabel. "The water's pretty cold, but it's nice&mdash;makes
your toes all pink."</p>

<p>"Of course you can. There isn't any danger,
because the water is shallow for a long,
long distance; and the sand is as hard and clean
as the very cleanest thing you can think of."</p>

<p>"Marble!" cried Mabel.</p>

<p>"Aunty Jane's house!" shouted Marjory.</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Mr. Black, "even as clean
as that. Now, away with you all. But keep
within hearing distance. I'm going to rest
awhile under this pleasant tree."</p>

<p>"And I," murmured Mrs. Crane, drowsily,
"am going to take a nap under <i>this</i> tree&mdash;I
can't stay awake a moment longer."</p>

<p>Presently Bettie, the kitten, and Mrs. Crane
were all sound asleep; and, from Mr. Black's
leafy shelter, a sound closely resembling gentle
snores proved most interesting to a puzzled
chipmunk, who had a pantry in that tree. The
chipmunk even perched on Mr. Black's toe to
listen; but the good, weary gentleman slumbered
unheedingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean, Marjory, Mabel, and Henrietta were
having a glorious time in the rippling blue lake.
When they were tired of splashing about to
scare the abundant minnows, they built wonderful
castles in the sand. Mabel's were square
and solid, like Mabel herself; Jean's were lofty
with aspiring towers and turrets, and Henrietta's
were honeycombed with fearsome dungeons.
Marjory built long streets of tiny,
modern, and excessively neat dwellings.</p>

<p>After that, they discovered that the beach
near the river's mouth was strewn with pebbles
of every hue known to pebbles. There
were agates, bits of glittering quartz and
granite, and many brown, green, or yellow
stones threaded prettily with a network of
white. They wanted to gather them all to
carry back to Bettie, but contented themselves
with about a bushel&mdash;all that their four skirts
would hold. But they found to their surprise
that they were anchored to the ground; that it
wasn't possible to rise with the heavy burden.
As for carrying the glittering hoard, that was
clearly impossible, too; so they heaped their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
treasure on the sand and ran to look at the
river where it joined the lake.</p>

<p>Never was there a more companionable
river. At the mouth it was only a yard wide
and just deep enough to cover one's ankles. A
little way up, it spread out as wide as a street,
but there it barely covered one's toes. Farther
up, there were big, moss-covered stones
and the water grew perceptibly deeper&mdash;up to
one's knees. Still further, and the river grew
wide and deep and darkly mysterious, where
great trees cast brown and green shadows over
the russet surface.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered Henrietta, at this point,
"let's go back&mdash;I like it better where it's narrow."</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Jean. "If there <i>were</i>
crocodiles in this part of the country, that's
where they'd live."</p>

<p>"Let's build a bridge across the narrowest
place," proposed Marjory.</p>

<p>All about were stones and driftwood. The
girls built a beautiful bridge and sat afterwards
on the beach to admire their handiwork;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but very soon the quiet water stealthily
washed the sand away from the foundation
stones and in a little while the river's mouth
was twice as wide as it had been before the
bridge, now floating lakeward, was built.</p>

<p>"I could stay here forever," said Henrietta,
"there are so many things to do&mdash;nice,
foolish things, like sand-castles, bridges that
float away, and stones that look like diamonds
when they're wet and like just stones when
they're dry. I'd like to <i>live</i> here."</p>

<p>"So would I," agreed Jean.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be nice," asked Marjory, "if
we <i>could</i> come here to camp?"</p>

<p>"We're here now," returned matter-of-fact
Mabel. "Let's pretend we really <i>are</i> camping."</p>

<p>"Look at the lake!" exclaimed Jean, suddenly.
"It isn't blue any more&mdash;it's all gray
and silver."</p>

<p>"And all the ripples are gone," observed
Henrietta. "See how flat and smooth it is
and how <i>lazy</i> it is along the edges. And the
sand is turning pink!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" warned quick-eared Marjory. "I
think Mr. Black's calling us&mdash;yes, he's waving
the tablecloth!"</p>

<p>After they had picked their way rather painfully
over the bed of sharp pebbles, the barefooted
girls ran gaily along the hard, smooth
beach&mdash;they were surprised to find themselves
so far from their foot-gear.</p>

<p>"Mr. Black seems excited," remarked Jean.
"I wonder if anything has happened."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Henrietta, soberly, "it's
time to go home."</p>

<p>"It <i>can't</i> be," protested Mabel. "We've
only just come&mdash;anyway, it seems so."</p>

<p>"That," explained Jean, sagely, "is because
this is the very nicest spot that ever grew."</p>

<p>"Hurry!" shouted Mr. Black; "don't wait
to put on your shoes&mdash;just bring them along."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>A Night Out</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"JEAN," queried Mr. Black, when the four rather
disheveled youngsters had scrambled
up the bank, "have you girls seen anything
of a boat?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Jean.</p>

<p>"Have you been on the shore all the time?"</p>

<p>"Every minute."</p>

<p>"I didn't <i>see</i> a boat," offered Henrietta,
"but about half an hour ago&mdash;or perhaps an
hour&mdash;I heard something that made a noise
like this: 'chug-chug, chuggity-chug, chug-chug-chuggity-chug'"&mdash;Henrietta
gave a very
fair imitation of a naptha launch.</p>

<p>"I heard it, too," admitted Margery.</p>

<p>"That was the boat," said Mr. Blank, scanning
the forsaken lake anxiously. "It's Hillitt's fish-tug
and it goes down to Lakeville at
sundown every day when the weather's fair.
The tug runs to Bear Bay. I expected to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
home on that boat; but, unfortunately, I went
to sleep and didn't wake up in time to signal
her."</p>

<p>"She was very far out," volunteered Jean.
"You couldn't have seen her from here&mdash;I
looked in every direction when I heard that
noise, but I couldn't see what was making it."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> thought," confessed Marjory, "that it
was some sort of an animal breathing queerly&mdash;I
didn't exactly like it."</p>

<p>"Evidently," said Mr. Black, "that boat
stayed a long way from shore&mdash;sound carries
a great distance over water. Anyway, that
eases my conscience a little. I ought not to
have fallen asleep, but I didn't suspect that
it was so late. You see, girls, our time is all
off. Goodness only knows how long it took
us to get here; and I'm sure I don't know
whether it was one, two, or three when we ate
our dinner. Now, what do you think that big,
golden sun's doing&mdash;over there behind those
trees?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Henrietta, eying it, sagely,
"that it's either going down or coming up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
And I <i>know</i> it can't be time for it to come
up."</p>

<p>"And it can't possibly be time," protested
Mabel, "for it to go down."</p>

<p>"I fear it is," said Mr. Black. "I ought
never to have taken that nap."</p>

<p>"Peter," demanded Mrs. Crane, suddenly
joining the group, "how are we ever going to
get home?"</p>

<p>"Sarah," replied Mr. Black, with one of
his sweet, whimsical smiles, "I'm blest if I
know."</p>

<p>"But, Peter, it's too far to walk; and the
Whale&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Sarah, I fully intended to go home
by boat. I was told that that boat passed here
every day. Well, it has passed, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Mrs. Crane, dryly, "it
<i>passed</i> all right."</p>

<p>"When the Whale broke down," continued
Mr. Black, soothingly, "I said to myself,
'Never mind, old chap, there's Hillitt's launch&mdash;we'll
hail that and ride home.'"</p>

<p>"And when you assured us that you knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of a safe and easy way to get home, you were
depending on that boat!"</p>

<p>"Sarah, don't rebuke me. I was. But, having
committed that fatal error, I'm willing to
atone for it. Hi there, girls! We'll all have
to work for our living for the next hour or
so. You see, good people, we'll probably have
to stay here all night unless somebody sees our
fire on the shore. Jean, I'm going to take
you and Henrietta to the Whale so you can
help me rob him of his lanterns and cushions.
Sarah, I want you and the girls to take this
hatchet, my knife, the bread-knife, and anything
else that is sharp, and cut as many balsam
boughs as you can from that grove of
evergreens over there&mdash;I want a whole wagon
load. Bettie, you can sit here on this log
and fill these two hamper-covers with chips&mdash;we'll
need a lot of firewood."</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Black and his two companions
were back with all the comforts that could be
stripped from the Whale. Dropping them near
the baskets of wood and the growing pile of
evergreen boughs, he went down to the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to select several tall poles from the half-buried
driftwood that past storms had heaped behind
the numerous big logs framing the upper edge
of the beach.</p>

<p>Having dug holes with a sharp stick, Mr.
Black planted the poles in an upright position;
and the sand, fortunately, held them firmly.
More poles were fastened securely across the
top; luckily Jean remembered seeing a tangle
of buckskin thongs hanging in the birch-bark
wigwam; Mr. Black appropriated those.
Along the beach were many odd lengths of
lumber cast up by a long series of storms;
these, too, were tied to the poles or securely
braced against them; for the castaways had no
nails.</p>

<p>The tablecloth&mdash;fortunately a generous one
as to size&mdash;was fastened on top for a roof.
This curious shack, when completed, was six
feet wide by about seventeen feet long. Three
sides were inclosed, but the fourth, the long
side facing the south, was left open.</p>

<p>"We'll build a fire outside," said Mr. Black,
"to keep our toes warm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The entire floor space inside the shack was
covered with balsam boughs. Mr. Black
showed the girls how to make them stand upright
like a forest of tiny trees&mdash;the twigs
were about fourteen inches long.</p>

<p>"It'll be almost like a mattress and springs,"
assured he, "when you have it finished. The
Whale has provided three light dust-covers and
three fairly heavy robes&mdash;we'll use those for
bedding."</p>

<p>"But," objected Marjory, who was not at
all sure that she was going to like the queer
bed that Mr. Black was making, "we haven't
any pillows."</p>

<p>"I guess," teased Mr. Black, "you'll have to
use your shoes&mdash;campers always do."</p>

<p>"The woods are full of pillows," assured
Bettie, who was helping with the balsam twigs.
"There's running pine on the ground under
the trees, a lot of nice green moss on the logs,
all sorts of big, soft ferns; and whole bushels
of leaves on the trees."</p>

<p>"That's right," commented Mr. Black.
"Suppose you girls gather about seven pillows&mdash;good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
big ones because the stuff will pack
down&mdash;off the nearest pillow-tree; and I'll see
if I can't find another wide board or two."</p>

<p>"Where," asked thoughtful Jean, "do all
the pieces of lumber come from?"</p>

<p>"There's a sawmill at Big Bear Harbor,
some fifteen miles north of here. I suppose a
good many boards get lost through careless
handling. None of this is first-class lumber,
however. This plank, you see, is full of knot-holes.
This one is hemlock and has two long
splits in it."</p>

<p>"I guess there's a shingle-mill somewhere,
too," said Bettie. "Mabel picked up a whole
basketful of pieces of brand-new shingles."</p>

<p>"Sarah," said Mr. Black, turning to his sister,
who still seemed rather stunned at the idea
of spending a night in the woods, "you'd better
fix some supper for us before it gets too
dark. Now that we have a house to live in,
we must have regular meals."</p>

<p>"What's that lean-to at the side for?" asked
Mrs. Crane, pointing to the row of boards that
rested against one end of the shack, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a triangular space about four feet wide by six
feet long.</p>

<p>"For me and the provisions," explained
Mr. Black. "I never <i>did</i> like sleeping seven
in a bed. And, in case it should rain, we must
keep our food dry."</p>

<p>"It's lucky," said Mrs. Crane, touching a
match to the neat fire that she had laid, "that
we all brought more of everything to eat than
we needed. And I'm glad I brought my old
gray shawl; it's as warm as a blanket."</p>

<p>"If it turns cold," said Mr. Black, "we'll
build a big fire just outside the open end of
our house. But I think it's going to be a comfortably
warm night&mdash;&mdash; There, I've got that
plank fastened at last and our palatial home
is finished. And bless me! Here comes the
pillow brigade with all its petticoats turned
into pillow-cases; and the brigade all giggling.
They're certainly a happy lot, Sarah."</p>

<p>"Mine's for Mr. Black," shouted Mabel.</p>

<p>"Mine's for Mrs. Crane," shrieked Marjory.</p>

<p>"And mine," said extravagant Henrietta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
dropping to her knees before Bettie, and proffering
her lace-trimmed burden, "is for the
Lady Bettina, with the devotion of her humblest
slave."</p>

<p>"I guess," said Mr. Black, eying the roof of
his house, ruefully, "that we'll have to eat
without a tablecloth. Sarah, how's that supper?"</p>

<p>"Just about ready," said Mrs. Crane, stirring
the cocoa with a long, clean stick. "The
water will boil in a moment or two and Jean
is cutting the bread."</p>

<p>The sun, red and glorious at the last, had
gone down; but, while the campers, seated in
a circle about the two dish-towels that Mrs.
Crane had spread for a cloth, were eating their
ample and delicious meal, the sky was so wonderful
and the lake so marvelous with its calm
surface touched lightly to burnished copper,
that the castaways all but forgot that they were
castaways, until Mr. Black brought them back
to earth.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing that troubles me,"
said he, "and that's the mothers and grandmothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and Aunty Janes that we left in Lakeville."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Crane, pouring a second
cup of cocoa for Bettie, "they're sure to worry.
No matter how far we've gone in the Whale,
we've always been home by bedtime."</p>

<p>"And I can't recall," said Mr. Black, running
his fingers through his thick, iron-gray
hair, "that I told a single soul exactly where
I was going."</p>

<p>"And none of the rest of us <i>knew</i>," retorted
his sister. "I've said, a great many
times, that your fondness for surprising us
would get us into trouble some day, and it
<i>has</i>."</p>

<p>"But it's pretty <i>nice</i> trouble," offered Bettie,
the peacemaker. "Of course all our grown-ups
will worry, because grown-ups always do,
anyway. But I'm sure they'll remember that
you've never lost any of us yet, or starved us,
or let us freeze."</p>

<p>"Granny will think," assured Henrietta,
giggling at the thought, "that we're staying
at a hotel, waiting for repairs on the Whale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
She <i>always</i> thinks of hotels as a safe refuge
for the homeless&mdash;she couldn't imagine a spot
<i>without</i> a convenient hotel."</p>

<p>"Well, if nothing rescues us to-night,"
promised Mr. Black, "I'll walk to Barclay's
Point at six to-morrow morning and hail that
fish-boat. It leaves Lakeville six times a week
at daybreak."</p>

<p>Their meal ended, the castaways sat in a circle
about the big driftwood fire that Mr. Black
built on the beach. Even Ambrosial Delight
enjoyed the unusual evening. He ran round
and round the group, just at the edge of the
darkness, chasing nocturnal insects or the shadows
cast by the flickering firelight; and once,
greatly to his own surprise and to the campers'
amusement, he leaped from a jutting log
into the smooth, glassy lake. After that surprising
experience, he was willing to lie cuddled
in Henrietta's lap.</p>

<p>When it became evident that nobody could
stay awake any longer, Mrs. Crane tucked all
her little charges&mdash;even to the kitten&mdash;away
for the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so sleepy," yawned Mabel, "that I
could sleep on cobblestones."</p>

<p>"We'll leave a big place for you, Mrs.
Crane," promised Jean, thoughtfully, "and
we'll remember not to lean too hard against
the walls."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Marjory, "isn't it
queer without sheets!"</p>

<p>"This bed feels good to <i>me</i>," murmured
Bettie, drowsily.</p>

<p>"Not a word more from anybody," said Mr.
Black, who had donned his fur automobile coat
and was crawling like a big shaggy bear into
his triangular den. "It's time all honest people
were asleep."</p>

<p>"I just wish," murmured Mrs. Crane,
stretching herself luxuriously upon her fragrant
balsam bed, "that all those mothers could
see how safe and comfortable we are. They'll
surely worry."</p>

<p>"They surely will," agreed Mr. Black,
drowsily, "for it's an unheard-of thing, in
Lakeville, for a picnic to stay out all night.
It's a calamity, but it can't be helped."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, never guessing that to a certain
about-to-be-shipwrecked boy their going home
at the proper time would have proved a far
greater calamity, the castaways closed their
eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>The Missing Whale</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>UNFORTUNATELY, the three mothers,
Henrietta's grandmother, and Aunty
Jane could not look into that queer chicken-coop
of a house to see their precious chickens
sleeping the sound, sweet sleep that life in
the open induces.</p>

<p>Still, the evening was so very fine that no
one was surprised because of the prolonged
outing&mdash;that is, at first. But when nine o'clock
came and the Whale failed to appear, Mrs.
Slater, Henrietta's grandmother, telephoned to
Mr. Black's unresponsive house, and then to
Jean's mother, Mrs. Mapes. Mrs. Mapes obligingly
ran in to ask Marjory's Aunty Jane if
anything had been seen of the delayed Whale;
and then both ladies scurried to the rectory
to ask Doctor Tucker if <i>he</i> knew the whereabouts
of the Whale&mdash;or the Whale's passengers.
Of course he didn't; so he and Mrs.
Tucker went with the inquiring pair to Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Bennett's to ask if Mabel had returned. Naturally,
she hadn't, so, joined by Mabel's now
mildly anxious parents, they all went&mdash;just
like persons in a moving-picture show, Doctor
Bennett said afterwards&mdash;to Mrs. Slater's
house to ask what <i>she</i> thought about it. They
found her anxiously watching the clock.</p>

<p>Mrs. Slater promptly sent Simmons, the
butler, to order her carriage, in which the entire
party, somewhat crowded it is true, was
speedily transported to Mr. Black's home,
where they found Martin waiting in the lighted
garage.</p>

<p>"Where," asked Doctor Bennett, "is your
master?"</p>

<p>"Sure," returned Martin, pulling politely at
a long lock of sandy hair, "that's what <i>I'd</i> like
to know. 'Tis a lonely evenin' I'm spendin'
without even a horse for company."</p>

<p>"Does his automobile ever break down?"
queried Aunty Jane, a thin woman with very
sharp eyes and other features to match.</p>

<p>"It never has, mum; but most of 'em does,
sooner or later. Still, Mr. Black is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
careful&mdash;he'd be likely to choose a safe spot to
break down in."</p>

<p>"He said," offered Doctor Tucker, "that he
was going to look at some land of his&mdash;where
is his land?"</p>

<p>"Sure," returned Martin, with a gesture
that included the entire horizon, "he has land
anywhere you'd want to look&mdash;he owns a pile
of rale estate, they say. When annybody
wants a little money, he just sells his land,
back taxes and all, to that aisy-going man.
<i>He</i> don't know where his land is; it's iv'rywhere.
But wheriver he's gone he can't
starve, for Mrs. Crane and Bridget cooked all
day yesterday; and he can't freeze because
there's three big robes and a fur coat."</p>

<p>"But what can be keeping him?" asked
Mrs. Tucker. "He knows that Bettie ought to
be in bed by nine."</p>

<p>"Most like it's a busted tire&mdash;'tis time wan
was givin' out. If he wasn't smart enough to
put the new one on&mdash;and belike he isn't, him
not bein' used to the job&mdash;why, there he is,
laid out in the road."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"But all our girls are with him," protested
Mrs. Bennett. "There's seven in the party.
Our five children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The more the merrier," consoled Martin,
comfortably. "Even if two or three was
spilled overboard, there'd be four left to
spread the tale. Depind on it, ladies&mdash;and
your Riverince&mdash;they're safe somewhere, or
we'd hear the bad news. That's the kind that
travels fastest."</p>

<p>"I think Martin is right," agreed Doctor
Tucker, mildly. "I'm quite sure that they're
all safe, <i>somewhere;</i> at some farm, perhaps,
where there's no telephone. Even if those girls
were alone they'd manage to make themselves
comfortable somehow&mdash;just remember what
they did to Dandelion Cottage."</p>

<p>"They're smart enough," agreed Mrs.
Mapes, "and they are all resourceful. And
Mrs. Crane is with them. If they haven't all
plunged over some embankment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not Mr. Black, mum," assured Martin.
"He's that careful and slow that I'm ashamed
to be seen ridin' with him. Why, mum, whin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I'm in the Whale I feel just like a baby in a
go-cart."</p>

<p>Their fears somewhat allayed by optimistic
Martin, the parents and guardians of the castaways,
after waiting hopefully until midnight,
finally dispersed and went to bed, for there
was really nothing else to do; but the passengers
of the missing Whale spent a far happier
and more peaceful night than did their anxious
relatives; for the castaways, at least, knew
that they were alive and unharmed.</p>

<p>The morning sun was shining brightly when
Ambrosial Delight, who had escaped at dawn,
chased a frightened chipmunk into Mr. Black's
triangular den and roused that recumbent gentleman
from the soundest sleep he had had in
years.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed the surprised
man, sitting up under his bias roof, "the stars
were shining when I looked out last! It must
be seven or eight o'clock. Hi there, Sarah!
Jean! Girls! Has that fish-boat gone up the
lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Bridget," murmured Mrs. Crane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
sleepily. "We'll have creamed shrimps
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sarah!" shouted Mr. Black, "wake up!
You've made me miss that boat again."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Crane woke up, and presently the
girls, with sleepy eyes and tousled heads,
crawled out, one by one, to blink in the dazzling
sunshine.</p>

<p>"Run down to the lake," advised Mr. Black,
"and wash your faces&mdash;that'll wake you up."</p>

<p>So the girls waded out and washed in the
finest basin in the world, made friends with
a courageous squirrel who was also bathing
his face, and combed their tangled locks with
Henrietta's side-combs.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't brought these," observed
Jean, "we'd have been in a fine fix."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," giggled Marjory, wiggling her
pink toes, delightedly, "there's water enough."</p>

<p>"Bettie," cried Mrs. Crane, from the bank,
"come out of that lake! You're a sick
girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not, either," contradicted Bettie, indignantly.
"I feel just fine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," returned motherly
Mrs. Crane, "but I don't want you to take
any risks. You've been in long enough."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Bettie, regretfully.
"I'll come out, just to be good, but I don't
want to one bit."</p>

<p>"Isn't this just heaven!" breathed Jean,
ecstatically, extending her arms as if she would
embrace the whole beautiful universe. "Look
at that water&mdash;pearl-gray, with pink and gold
sparkles all spangled over the top! It's a different
color every time you look at it. I love
it."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Bettie, from the beach. "I
wish I were a fish and could <i>live</i> in it."</p>

<p>"But then," objected Henrietta, "you
couldn't <i>see</i> it&mdash;I'd rather be a sea-gull."</p>

<p>"She's making puns," groaned Marjory.
"Hurry up with that comb, Mabel; it's my
turn next."</p>

<p>"Hi there!" called Mr. Black; "who's setting
the table for breakfast?"</p>

<p>As the tablecloth was still serving as a roof,
Mr. Black found a couple of clean boards that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
served very nicely in its stead. This was not
difficult, since all the driftwood was most beautifully
clean. So, too, was the sand. Even
the soil under the trees, being free from clay,
was clean, dry, and pleasant. One could sit
on the ground without fear of dampness, dirt,
or snakes. It was <i>pleasant</i> ground.</p>

<p>"This place," said Mrs. Crane, who was
boiling the coffee water, "is absolutely dust-proof,
I believe. I'd like to live here all the
time, if only to breathe this air."</p>

<p>"Let's stay," pleaded Bettie. "<i>I</i> don't want
to go home."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Nor I," echoed Marjory, who had finally
succeeded in braiding her long, fair
hair.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Mr. Black, "we'll <i>have</i> to
stay for awhile, whether we want to or not.
But, if we don't turn up to-day, they'll begin
to hunt for us."</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned Henrietta, "I <i>hope</i> not."</p>

<p>"Peter," said Mrs. Crane, "we didn't meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a single soul on that road after we took the
turn-off just out of Lakeville."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," returned Mr. Black.
"Nobody that could possibly travel by any
other road would ever think of taking that one.
I suspect that it hasn't been used very much
since Randall stopped lumbering at Barclay's
Point, six years ago. But, never fear, they'll
find us all right&mdash;we're only seventeen miles
from Lakeville."</p>

<p>"But <i>such</i> miles," breathed Mrs. Crane.
"Nobody 'd think of trying that road&mdash;they'd
think we had more sense."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we should have had&mdash;perhaps I
ought to have doubted Timothy. Anyway, we
left tracks. If they look for us at all thoroughly,
they'll surely find those."</p>

<p>"That Timothy man," suggested Jean.
"Wouldn't <i>he</i> know?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," admitted Mr. Black, "but when
I asked him about that road he was just boarding
a train for Boston. But don't worry.
We're not half as lost as we might be. In
fact, <i>we</i> know exactly where we are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The castaways had barely finished breakfast
when sharp-eyed Marjory spied a small, dark
object on the water, not far from Barclay's
Point.</p>

<p>"That wasn't there yesterday," said she,
pointing it out to the others.</p>

<p>"It's moving!" cried Jean.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's more driftwood for our
house," suggested Bettie.</p>

<p>"Or a bear coming to eat us," offered
Mabel.</p>

<p>"It's long and slim with a bump at one
end," explained Marjory. "Something like
a dead tree with one branch sticking up. Just
a log, perhaps, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anyway," interrupted Jean, "it's coming
this way and coming <i>fast</i>."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>The Coming of Dave</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE castaways, forgetting that there were
dishes to be washed, stood in an eager
row on the bank above the beach. The floating
object continued to approach. Soon they
could see why it moved; the blade of a broad
paddle gleamed in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"It's a boat!" cried Marjory.</p>

<p>"A canoe," announced Mr. Black. "See,
one end is low, the other fairly out of the
water. Let's stand behind these bushes, girls&mdash;the
shack is so far back that the man in
the canoe won't notice it if he doesn't see the
tablecloth. I'll take it down, I guess. You
see, there's just a chance that that fellow might
not land if he saw people here&mdash;and we need
him in our business. We'll be quiet, too. He
seems to be making for this little bay."</p>

<p>The boat and its occupant were an even
shade of dark brown, but the paddle gleamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
golden in the sunshine. The canoe, skilfully
propelled by a practised hand, shot rapidly
toward the strip of sand at the very feet of
the almost breathless watchers and, in a very
few seconds more, was safely beached. A
snarling, stealthy dog leaped ashore and began
to sniff suspiciously at the sand; but his owner,
fortunately, paid no attention to him. The
paddler proved to be an Indian half-breed,
bareheaded and clad only in shirt and trousers.
His clothes were old and greasy, his bare brown
feet far from clean. He flung from the canoe
a fish-net, two dead muskrats, and, although
it was out of season, a small saddle of venison.
He spread the net on the sand to dry, threw
the venison upon his shoulder, and climbed the
bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Black, stepping from the sheltering
bush, met him when he reached the top.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said he.</p>

<p>The startled Indian almost dropped his
burden.</p>

<p>"Goo'-morn'," he grunted, surlily.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Mr. Black, closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
scrutinizing the half-breed's not very prepossessing
countenance, "I think I've met you
before. You're Dave Gurneau, the man I
bought this land from."</p>

<p>"Yass, I guess, mebbe-so," returned Dave.
"You ol' Pete Black, I t'ank so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the gentleman, "I'm old
Pete Black. But what are <i>you</i> doing here?
I thought I bought this land with the understanding
that you were to vacate it&mdash;leave it&mdash;get
off of it? How long have you lived here?"</p>

<p>The culprit wriggled his toes in the sand.</p>

<p>"Ever since Ah'm sell heem," returned
Dave, whose small black eyes were shifty.</p>

<p>"Well!" gasped Mr. Black, "that's nerve
for you&mdash;stayed right here, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yass, Ah'm stay hon dose plass. Me, I
must sell dese lan' to you so I can buy proveesion
enough for leeve hon heem&mdash;som' leetle
onion, som' potate, som' flour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you sold me the land so you could
live on it!"</p>

<p>"Yass&mdash;Ah'm got to buy proveesion sometam'.
You good, easy man, Ah'm tole."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"He means easy mark," breathed Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;switched," declared Mr.
Black, endeavoring to frown at guilty Dave;
but, meeting Bettie's dancing eyes, he laughed
instead.</p>

<p>"Dave," said he, "you're an unprecedented
rascal. You've caught my fish, picked my berries,
killed my game; but I'll forgive you if
you'll do an errand for me. Do you think
you could walk to Lakeville?"</p>

<p>"Sure t'ing," replied Dave, whose shifty
eyes had traveled speculatively from one to
another of the group. "Ah'm walk dere
plantee tam'. Got to sleep two-t'ree hour, den
go."</p>

<p>"Very well," returned Mr. Black; "I'd
<i>rather</i> you'd start at once, but if you need
sleep, you'd better get it now than on the way.
I'll write Saunders (Saunders was Mr.
Black's trusted secretary) to send a launch or
a wagon for us and horses for the automobile."</p>

<p>"Peter," queried Mrs. Crane, wistfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
"do we <i>have</i> to go home? You know we
talked of coming here to camp, anyway. Now
that we're here, why can't we stay? I suppose
it's a crazy scheme; but that road is too
rough to travel over very often, and you know
I never did like the water&mdash;I'm always seasick.
Saunders could send us all the things
we need&mdash;tents and everything else. And all
the parents would be willing&mdash;they were all
in favor of a camping trip <i>sometime</i>. We'd
write and explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> stay," cried Jean.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i>," implored Bettie, flinging her arms
about Mr. Black's neck.</p>

<p>"<i>Please</i> do," begged Henrietta, impulsively
seizing a hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, do, do, <i>do</i>," shrieked Marjory, seizing
the other hand.</p>

<p>"I'll wash all the dishes," promised Mabel,
throwing her arms about Mr. Black's stout
waist, "and everybody knows that that's a
job I hate."</p>

<p>"I'll get fat," promised Bettie.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Black was ever a warm-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and obliging man, with a wonderful love for
children in general&mdash;his own little dark-eyed
daughter had died in infancy&mdash;and for Bettie
in particular. Even if the plan did seem a bit
wild and venturesome (and Mr. Black himself
was something of an adventurer, in the best
sense of that word), it was not easy to say no
with all those clinging arms about him, those
eager, pleading young faces upturned expectantly
to his. Moreover, few persons, Mr.
Black least of all, were able to resist the appeal
in Bettie's big, black, always rather pathetic
eyes. And already, best argument of
all, the slender little maid seemed to be improving
under these new conditions.</p>

<p>"Well," capitulated Mr. Black, "it will take
Dave some hours to get to Lakeville, and it
may take considerable time for Saunders to
find a boat or horses to come up here&mdash;we'll
have to leave all that part of it to his discretion.
It may be to-morrow morning before we
are rescued. Now, I'll agree to this. We'll send
him a list of everything we need. If we are
still desirous of staying when the things come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and if there's nothing in my mail to call me
to town, we'll stay. If we're tired of it, we'll
just cart the stuff home again. We'll each
make out a list&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On what, I'd like to know?" interrupted
Mrs. Crane. "I've used all the wrapping paper
to start fires."</p>

<p>Mr. Black, shaking off the clinging children,
searched in the pockets of his clothes.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," said he. "The only
scrap of paper I can spare is already covered
with memoranda."</p>

<p>Dave, who had been silently waiting, laughed
appreciatively. It was an unexpectedly pleasant
sound, too; for the half-breed's voice was
soft and deep.</p>

<p>"Lots of paper on top of som' tree," he
said. "Ah br-r-reeng som'."</p>

<p>"I can see leaves," laughed Henrietta,
squinting upward, "but no pages."</p>

<p>"He means birch bark," explained quick-witted
Marjory. "See, he's cutting big
squares of it."</p>

<p>When the squares were peeled into many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
thin sheets (the girls thought that great sport)
Mr. Black distributed them among the other
castaways.</p>

<p>"Here are two pencils," said he. "I'll use
my fountain pen."</p>

<p>"And I always have pencils in my bag," said
Mrs. Crane. "I'll tend to the provisions,
Peter, if you'll look out for the other things.
Be sure, girls, to ask for extra shoes and
stockings; you'll need those and something
warm to sleep in."</p>

<p>Noting that one more pencil was needed,
Dave began to fumble in an apparently bottomless
pocket. From the depths he finally produced
a grimy, greasy stub, which he offered
to pencil-less Marjory.</p>

<p>But Marjory, fastidious little maid that she
was, drew back from it, loathingly, and declined.</p>

<p>Gentle-mannered Jean, promptly surmising
that Dave's feelings might be hurt, handed her
own clean, long pencil to Marjory and accepted
Dave's offering, with a sweet-voiced
"thank you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>From that moment, Dave was Jean's abject
slave; and, if the proofs of his devotion were
not always welcome, they at least proved
numerous.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>Delivered by Dave</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BY this time, of course, the mothers, Aunty
Jane, the solitary grandmother, and even
the fathers, were decidedly alarmed; for morning
disclosed the disquieting fact that the
Whale was still missing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Slater thought that somebody ought
to call up the police; Mrs. Tucker suggested
sending the militia forth on horseback to scour
the surrounding country. Aunty Jane advised
ringing the fire bell.</p>

<p>"All nonsense," blustered Doctor Bennett,
more worried than he was willing to admit;
but, since all the alarmed ladies, singly and
collectively, had appealed to him for advice,
it was necessary of course to appear as unconcerned
as possible. "All nonsense, I say.
If Mr. Black has had an accident with his
car he probably doesn't care to have the fact
advertised. Nor do we want the whole town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
worrying about our children. Be reasonable.
There isn't a road in the country that crosses
a railroad track; there isn't an inch of road
anywhere about that skirts any dangerous declivity.
The Whale <i>might</i> get stuck in some
swamp or stalled in the sand or lose a tire or
run short of gasoline. In any of those cases,
they'd take refuge <i>somewhere</i>, while waiting
for repairs. Folks with automobiles often get
held up for a night. There's just one thing
for us to do. That is, to wait. Go home,
everybody, and <i>wait</i>."</p>

<p>So, only partly relieved of their fears,
though frequently upheld by encouraging Doctor
Bennett, these good people waited throughout
the long, dreary day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To return to the castaways, it required
nearly every minute of the two hours that
Dave spent in slumber to prepare those lists
and various letters, for they all needed a great
deal of revising.</p>

<p>Henrietta's was the last note to be finished,
because that ingenious maid added a miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
number of postscripts. All the other missives
were tied together with a stout string;
when Henrietta, who had seized hers at the
last moment to add a request for marshmallows,
discovered that Dave, with the large
packet inside his shirt, was already making
for the path out of the clearing.</p>

<p>Henrietta flew after him with the note,
which was addressed very clearly to Mrs.
Slater. Dave laughed, thrust the note lightly
into the pocket of his shirt, and vanished&mdash;Dave
had a curious way of melting, with surprising
suddenness, from one's sight.</p>

<p>"He'll lose that," declared Henrietta, returning
to the group sheltered under a big pine
tree&mdash;the June sun was bright in the clearing.
"I wish it were tied up with the
others."</p>

<p>It was fortunate, however, that it was not;
for the Indian proved an erratic postman.</p>

<p>It took Dave less time than Mr. Black had
supposed it would to reach Lakeville&mdash;and a
Lakeville friend, dwelling on the outskirts of
the town. This hospitable friend considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it necessary to refresh his visitor with the contents
of a large, flat bottle.</p>

<p>Now, Dave was very easily affected by
strong drink. After he had parted from his
generous host, he remembered hazily that he
had something to deliver to somebody&mdash;he
cherished a dim recollection of a flying, girlish
figure, a bright, youthful countenance, and a
letter. That was it, a letter. He groped in
his trousers pockets. Nothing there. In his
loose belt. Nothing there. In the pocket of
his dingy shirt. Yes, there it was.</p>

<p>Clutching it firmly, the staggering Indian
searched the sky above him with bleared but
inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>"What ye lookin' for?" asked Pat Mulligan,
the policeman.</p>

<p>"Pos'&mdash;pos' office," replied Dave, with a
wide, friendly smile. "Let&mdash;letters s'mail."</p>

<p>"Give it here," said Pat, "I'm goin' right
there myself."</p>

<p>With that, he escorted trusting Dave to the
village lockup. This safely accomplished, he
studied the address on the birch-bark note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure," observed Pat, "there's no stamp on
this. 'Twas plainly meant to be delivered by
hand. On the Avenoo, is it? I'm knowin' the
house&mdash;I'll take it there."</p>

<p>Which the good-natured officer did, to the
great relief of Mrs. Slater, who, in spite of
Doctor Bennett's assurances, was almost wild,
by this time, with anxiety.</p>

<p>"Dear Granny," extravagant Henrietta had
written. "I'm a wild Indian in the loveliest
woods in the world. We're all safe and comfortable
and we're going to stay <i>forever</i>, so
send me a nightie and a toothbrush, some
stockings, my tennis shoes, my oldest dress,
some underwear; and, if you love me, a clean
towel&mdash;a fuzzy one. Affectionately, Henrietta.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I'd like a pillow-case, <i>if</i> you please.
And a sheet.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Oh, yes&mdash;I need my hairbrush and
my bathing suit.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;And a lot of things to eat; bread,
pie, cake, cookies, fruit, and fish-hooks.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Please can I have a red bandanna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
handkerchief and a button to sew on my petticoat.
Also, a pair of shoe strings.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Peanuts and everything else you can
thing of to eat and wear.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Please send the bundle to Mr.
Black's office to Mr. Saunders.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;A can of condensed milk for Anthony
Fitz-Hubert, if they <i>do</i> call the poor dear
'Ambrosial Delight.'</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;A whole bushel of marshmallows
for <i>me</i>. I love you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Slater, a bright old lady with sparkling
black eyes, not unlike Henrietta's own, read
this letter with very evident enjoyment. Then
she went to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Is this Doctor Tucker?" she asked.
"Have you heard from Bettie? Oh, haven't
you? Well, I have&mdash;that is, from Henrietta.
They are safe and comfortable; and, I should
judge from Henrietta's note, uproariously
happy. If you'll call up the Bennetts and Marjory's
Aunt Jane, I'll tell Mrs. Mapes. Then
I'll drive round, presently, and let you see the
note&mdash;no, she didn't mention the Whale&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fancy your girls will want as many things as
Henrietta does. Don't forget to tell the others&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>This, of course, relieved the anxious minds
of the parents; and Doctor Bennett was
thoughtful enough to inform Martin that the
party was safe.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the next morning, Dave was
given an opportunity to appear before Judge
Wilson and tell his story. The delayed notes
came to light, and by noon were properly distributed,
whereupon there was a grand scurrying
in several households; and in Mr. Black's
office as well.</p>

<p>"What," asked puzzled Mrs. Bennett, running
into Mrs. Tucker's conveniently near
house, "did Bettie ask for? This is every
word Mabel wrote."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett drew a scrap of bark from her
blouse. Mrs. Tucker laughed when she read it.</p>

<p>"Dear Mother:" wrote Mabel. "Please
send about a thousand bananas. We are going
to stay here."</p>

<p>All around this was an elaborate border of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
drawings&mdash;attempts at squirrels. Mabel had
left no room for further writing.</p>

<p>"I hope," Mrs. Tucker said, eying the drawings,
apprehensively, "that that place isn't infested
with rats."</p>

<p>"They're <i>rabbits</i>," explained Mrs. Bennett,
with conviction. "Mabel has quite a talent
for drawing. But I wish she'd <i>written</i> a little
more."</p>

<p>"She probably needs all the articles that Bettie
asks for," said Mrs. Tucker. "Bettie says
she's feeling fine. I suppose they found an
empty farmhouse and took possession of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Bennett, "I can just
<i>see</i> them moving into those empty rooms and
making them as homelike as possible."</p>

<p>It was a good thing, perhaps, that Mrs. Bennett
<i>couldn't</i> see the house that her daughter
was living in; for it certainly wasn't much of
a house, even with the extra touches that Mr.
Black was adding at that very moment. But
of course it was better than none. The good
lady, re-enforced by Bettie's really useful list,
went home to hunt up as many as she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
locate of Mabel's scattered belongings; for Mabel,
ever the untidiest of mortals, kept her
wardrobe in the unlikeliest of places.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Saunders certainly had his hands
full collecting all the things for which Mr.
Black and his good sister had asked&mdash;these
hospitable souls were bent on providing their
guests with every possible comfort. It was not
easy, either, to find a boatman willing or able
to go so far&mdash;the distance was greater by
water than by land.</p>

<p>When all else was packed in Captain Berry's
gasoline launch, Mr. Saunders paid Dave's fine
and secured his release from the jail, for Mr.
Black had written that Dave was to ride with
the motley cargo. This cargo was all aboard,
even to Mabel's bananas, but it was the morning
of the following day before the boat was
able to start, because Captain Berry, the
launch-man, had discovered at dusk that his
gasoline barrel was empty. By that time Dave
was missing. But dauntless Mr. Saunders employed
Mulligan, the policeman, to find him;
and Dave, very much the worse for the liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
portion of his breakfast, was finally loaded,
with his snarling dog, aboard the launch.
Dave, it was only too plainly evident, was unable
to resist the temptations of town life.</p>

<p>At last, however, to the great relief of Mr.
Saunders, the launch was started on its way.
"I feel," said the weary bachelor, turning
away from the wharf, "just like the father of
a whole orphan asylum."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>The Pangs of Hunger</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BY this time, the castaways were on the
brink of starvation. They had feasted all
the first day, and, with the prospect of more
provisions coming, had eaten all they could
hold on the second; that was no small amount,
for the fresh air had quickened all their appetites.
On the third they ate about all there
was left for breakfast.</p>

<p>"We might as well," said Mrs. Crane, "for
the boat or the wagon will surely be here by
noon, or, at worst, by night."</p>

<p>But, thanks to unreliable Dave, the castaways'
calculations were all wrong. Not a
crumb arrived that day. For their noon meal,
they drank some very weak cocoa, some broken
crackers, and some crusts that Mabel had left
at breakfast time. Mabel always left her
crusts; though now that she had nothing else
to eat, they tasted, as Mabel said, almost as
good as cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"This won't do," said Mr. Black, putting his
share of the fragments on Bettie's wooden
plate. "I'm going to rob that Indian's wigwam
and we'll have a real meal just as soon
as we can cook it."</p>

<p>"If we were toads," offered Mabel, disconsolately
eying her empty plate, "we could eat
toadstools. I saw a lot of awfully queer ones
along the road that leads to Barclay's Point."</p>

<p>"Toadstools?" questioned Mr. Black, pausing
in his flight. "What were they like?"</p>

<p>"Very pointed at the top," returned Mabel.
"Some of them were shaped just like big,
smooth eggs and some were spread out flat like
a parasol."</p>

<p>"What color were they?"</p>

<p>"Gray&mdash;sort of silvery. One of the big ones
was all wet on the edges with shoeblacking&mdash;all
drippy."</p>

<p>"Inky mushrooms!" exclaimed Mr. Black
and Mrs. Crane, in one breath.</p>

<p>"Sarah," continued Mr. Black, "you go
with Mabel and look at those 'toadstools'
while I burglarize Dave's wigwam. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
we'll have a meal even if it doesn't happen to
be mealtime."</p>

<p>"I guess," mourned Bettie, "we fed too
many scraps to the squirrels."</p>

<p>The toadstools proved to be a very fine variety
of "inky" mushrooms (long afterwards
Jean learned that the proper name for this
mushroom was <i>coprinus atramentarius</i>).
They grew in generous clusters and it was
great fun to gather the queer, slippery objects
and pack them carefully in Mrs. Crane's basket,
which was soon filled. Mr. Black returned
with a number of potatoes, a saucepan, part of
the Indian's venison, some salt, and a little
flour.</p>

<p>"That," explained Mr. Black, "is to thicken
the gravy. Here, Jean, hand me that frying-pan
for my venison cutlets. Marjory, you
may run to the beach with these potatoes and
wash them. Take this saucepan with you and
scour that, too&mdash;use sand. I'll build a good
fire and get a pail of water. Here come the
mushroom gatherers. What luck, Sarah?
Phew! You <i>have</i> made a haul!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are they really good to eat?" queried Bettie,
distrustfully.</p>

<p>"One of the very best kinds that grow."</p>

<p>"And you're sure that these are that kind?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure. Sarah and I used to gather
them when we were children, didn't we, Sarah?
I'm glad there's a tiny corner of butter left
to fry them in."</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon, this curiously
acquired meal was ready; and, although
the potatoes were plain boiled with their jackets
on and the gravy was pretty lumpy, it all tasted
very good indeed to the hungry castaways.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Mabel, taking most of the
credit for the mushrooms to herself, "that I
just about saved your lives."</p>

<p>"Or poisoned us," remarked Marjory, who
wasn't quite sure that she liked mushrooms.
"I'm glad, anyway, that we've enough meat
and potatoes and gravy left for another meal."</p>

<p>"That venison," said Mr. Black, beaming
at his satisfied family, "was certainly good."</p>

<p>"Mr. Black," queried Henrietta, her black
eyes twinkling saucily, "didn't I hear you say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that you were going to have Dave arrested for
getting game out of season? What happens to
people that <i>eat</i> it out of season?"</p>

<p>"They get arrested, imprisoned, and fined,"
said Mr. Black, "provided the game warden
catches them. I'm glad you asked that question,
Henrietta. Girls, you are not to mention
this venison in town or to any chance visitor
that may come this way. And don't point out
that wigwam to any stranger&mdash;there are too
many evidences of Dave's crimes about the
place. Besides, they're on my property&mdash;they
<i>might</i> hold me responsible."</p>

<p>"Particularly if they caught you with the
bones on your plate," remarked Mrs. Crane,
dryly. "And, in any case, you stole that
venison."</p>

<p>"Dave owes me a lot more than this for
rent," returned Mr. Black. "But we won't
have to break any game laws if Saunders sends
the fishing tackle I ordered. There are three
good meals a day swimming about in our own
river."</p>

<p>"What," asked Bettie, "is that net for&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
one that Dave left on the beach? Why can't
you fish with that?"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Mr. Black, "that <i>is</i>
fishing tackle. But that's against the law, too.
It's to stretch across the river for trout; but
that form of sport isn't permitted. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peter, you <i>wouldn't!</i>" protested Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>"Sarah, I <i>would</i>&mdash;if it were necessary to
keep us from hunger. But if I ever do&mdash;girls,
<i>whatever</i> I do, you must remember about that
game warden."</p>

<p>"We will," promised Henrietta.</p>

<p>"We will," chorused the others.</p>

<p>And when the time came, they did; but you
shall hear about that after awhile.</p>

<p>The castaways were up bright and early the
next morning. For one thing the mosquitoes
troubled them; hitherto the light breeze blowing
across their camp ground had kept these pests
away; but the night had been unusually still
and the tantalizing insects had discovered the
sleeping campers. For another thing, everybody
wanted to be up and as much dressed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
possible when the boat or the wagon should
come. This uncertainty as to whether relief
would arrive by land or approach by water
added very considerably to the excitement. It
wasn't possible for the girls to do much of
anything except to run by turns to the spot
whence one could look down the road and to
that other spot from which one could view the
lake. Unfortunately there was no one spot
that commanded both these avenues of approach.</p>

<p>Just at noon, a shrill screech from Marjory,
prancing precariously on the edge of the bank,
announced that relief was in sight.</p>

<p>"A ship&mdash;a ship!" shrieked keen-sighted
Marjory.</p>

<p>"Where away?" demanded Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"There she blows!" quoted Marjory, employing
the only other nautical term she could
call to mind and pointing with an extended
forefinger.</p>

<p>"That's not a whale&mdash;that's a boat," scoffed
Henrietta, who had traveled. "It's whales
that blow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care," returned Marjory. "And
boats do too, when they have whistles. Anyhow,
I saw it first&mdash;&mdash; Look out, Mabel!"</p>

<p>But the frail edge of the bank had already
crumbled under weighty Mabel, who, unexpectedly,
shot downward to the beach. No
harm was done, however, for the sand was
clean and soft.</p>

<p>"Mabel," laughed Mr. Black, "you'll have
my whole hundred-and-twenty acres in the
lake if you don't stop tumbling off the edge
of my property. This isn't the first time you've
taken a large slice off the landscape."</p>

<p>"It's about the ninth," admitted Mabel,
scrambling back to the grassy top. "I'm always
forgetting how easily it breaks away."</p>

<p>"That's because it sticks out a little over the
top," explained sage Jean. "In very stormy
weather the waves wash against the bank and
scoop it out."</p>

<p>"I suppose that <i>is</i> our boat," said Mr. Black,
rubbing his chin, "and I hope my razor's on
it&mdash;I must look like a pirate by this time, or
a tramp."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Coatless Mr. Black, without his daily shave
and with his broken suspenders mended with
odd bits of twine, certainly did look rather unlike
his usually neat self.</p>

<p>"That boat isn't coming very fast," complained
Marjory.</p>

<p>"It's a very clear day," explained Mrs.
Crane, "so you can see a long distance. That
boat is probably several miles away."</p>

<p>In spite of their impatience, the boat remained
several miles away for a long, long
time.</p>

<p>"If that <i>is</i> a boat," said Mr. Black, "it's the
very slowest one on Lake Superior."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Jean, "it's going the
other way."</p>

<p>But the boat was neither going nor coming.
The engine had balked; and Captain Berry, for
it really <i>was</i> Captain Berry, was waiting, as
he had often waited before, for his defective
electrical apparatus to get good and ready to
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>An Exciting Afternoon</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IT was three o'clock before the speck on the
water began to show signs of life.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Bettie, who spent much
time lying on her stomach on the beach with
her heels in the air, since she was not permitted
to use them recklessly for walking purposes.
"I hear something 'chugging.' Listen, everybody."</p>

<p>"I do believe it's really coming," announced
Marjory, who was perched on a fallen pine
tree, whose upturned root rested edgewise on
the bank while its trunk, firmly upheld by the
stout stubs of its broken branches, extended
far out over the shallow water. Light-footed
Marjory delighted in running the length of
that log, or in perching at its outer end. Henrietta
enjoyed it, too. Sometimes all the girls
sat on it in a giggling row, with their feet
dangling over the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Black, rolling up his sleeves
(there would be plenty of work for all hands
when the boat should arrive), "that craft is
certainly headed this way."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Mr. Black, with a comprehensive
glance that swept the entire group,
"how many of you would like to go home
when that boat goes back?"</p>

<p>"Not I," cried Bettie.</p>

<p>"Not I," echoed Jean.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay forever," declared Henrietta.</p>

<p>"As for me," said Mabel, "I feel as if I'd
only just got here!"</p>

<p>"You don't look it," said Henrietta;
"there's a suspiciously dark ring about your
neck, your wrists are black, and you're fairly
bursting out between your buttons."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Mabel, "there isn't much
use in taking a bath when you haven't any soap
or towels or clean clothes. You just wait till
my&mdash;gracious!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Jean; for over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Mabel's plump and not over-clean countenance
had spread a look of blank dismay.</p>

<p>"I never asked for a thing but bananas,"
groaned the youngest member of Mr. Black's
flock.</p>

<p>"You can string the skins and wear those,"
suggested Henrietta, wickedly, for she delighted
in teasing Mabel. "You've seen pictures
of Fiji Islanders, haven't you? Well,
no doubt you'll come to that."</p>

<p>"Never mind," soothed Jean, the peacemaker.
"Mother always sends a lot more of
everything than anybody needs; so perhaps
I'll be able to lend you a thing or two. I'd
do anything to stay."</p>

<p>"How is it with you, Sarah?" asked Mr.
Black. "Do <i>you</i> want to go home?"</p>

<p>"Peter," replied Mrs. Crane, "this <i>is</i>
home."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to think," said Mr. Black,
"that we were all born wild Indians. I don't
want to go home myself; and I hope that
Saunders won't send any news that will make
me feel that I ought to. How about you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Ambrosial Delight? Do <i>you</i> like the woods,
little cat?"</p>

<p>The frisky kitten, always responsive to attention,
scrambled up Mr. Black's leg, leaped
to his broad shoulder, and began running in a
circle round and round Mr. Black's neck.</p>

<p>"He says," interpreted Henrietta, "that he
wouldn't go home for the best cow's milk in
the country."</p>

<p>At last the boat, headed straight for the
shore, was so near that the campers could see
that every available inch of the craft was filled
with boxes, bundles, and baskets. The excited
little girls pranced so recklessly on the edge
of the bank that a lot more of it crumbled and
rolled to the beach, a youngster or two with it.
Mabel, anxious to obtain a closer view of the
boat's cargo, as Captain Berry dropped anchor,
rushed recklessly toward the end of the
long, prostrate pine.</p>

<p>"Oh!" shrieked Marjory, "you're shaking
the whole log! Oh! Oh! Don't touch <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>But Marjory's admonition came too late.
Plump, clumsy Mabel, feeling the need of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
some other support than the log afforded, flung
her arms about her slender comrade. There
was another alarmed shriek from Marjory, two
wildly scrambling figures clutching at empty
air&mdash;and a prodigious splash. The water at
this point was just knee deep; enough of it,
fortunately, to break the girls' fall and not
enough to drown them.</p>

<p>Dave and his dog plunged overboard from
the launch and waded rapidly to the rescue.
That is, Dave waded and Onota swam. Mr.
Black, too, waded hurriedly to the spot where
Mabel, on all-fours, was endeavoring to stand
upright and where Marjory was thrashing
about like a frenzied trout.</p>

<p>Dave seized one, Mr. Black the other, and,
in another moment the girls were safe on their
feet, gasping, sputtering, and trying to wipe
their wet faces on their wetter skirts.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing," said Mr. Black, leading
his half of the rescued victims ashore,
"that your dry clothes are in sight."</p>

<p>"I only hope they are," breathed Mabel.
"I didn't <i>ask</i> for any."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>As there was no dock, the launch could not
be taken very close to shore, so her cargo was
carefully unloaded by Captain Berry into one
of the three small boats that he was towing.
Dave, already so wet that a little more moisture
did not matter, pushed this smaller craft
ashore. The boat's nose was drawn up on a
strip of wet sand, perhaps three feet across.
Next to this came about twenty feet of dry,
white sand. After that a sand bank eight feet
high led by a steep path to the grassy plateau
above.</p>

<p>"All hands unload," shouted Mr. Black,
seizing some of the lighter parcels and tossing
them up to Mrs. Crane, who carried them back
a few yards from the edge and piled them
under a tree. The girls grabbed baskets and
bundles, too, and scrambled up the steep bank
with them and scurried down again for more.
Mabel and Marjory worked also, which was
better than sitting still in wet clothes; and
Dave, Captain Berry, and Mr. Black toiled up
the bank with the heavier articles. When the
first boat load was cared for, the little craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was rowed back to the launch for another cargo&mdash;it
made four trips.</p>

<p>Two of the small boats that Captain Berry
had towed behind the launch were pulled high
on the beach, with oars and oar-locks laid
carefully inside. The girls were delighted
when they learned that they were to be left
at the camp.</p>

<p>Some of the baskets and bundles were addressed
to the little girls and you may be certain
that it wasn't long before those eager children
had the wrappings torn from their many
parcels.</p>

<p>"Hey!" shrieked Mabel, prancing heavily
on one foot and waving aloft a pair of stockings
and a freshly laundered petticoat, "they
<i>did</i> send my clothes, and my bananas, too.
Now I can dress up."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, because, if ever a human
being looked in need of clean garments,
Mabel did. Her tumble into the lake, followed
by sundry other tumbles up and down the sand
bank, had certainly not improved the appearance
of Mabel's pink gingham frock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've two clean dresses, too," added Mabel,
after another excursion into her basket, "and
a cake of soap."</p>

<p>At sight of the soap, the girls fairly shrieked
with mirth.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake," advised Marjory, "go
use it."</p>

<p>Mr. Black found the hammer he had sent
for (fortunately Saunders had marked the outside
of all the parcels that he had packed, so
that one could be reasonably certain as to the
nature of the contents) and knocked the covers
off all the boxes in order to ascertain if everything
he had ordered had been sent. When
he and Mrs. Crane were satisfied as to this
matter, they told Captain Berry that everything
was all right.</p>

<p>"But," suggested Mrs. Crane, "hadn't he
better come back in about a week to see if we
need anything? And there's the Whale&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can send Dave to town again if we
find we need provisions. And Saunders writes
that he couldn't tell from Dave's directions
how to reach us with horses and would await<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
further orders concerning the car. Now that
I have tools I can build a temporary shelter
over the Whale."</p>

<p>"I'll have to be starting homeward pretty
soon," said Captain Berry, who had been casting
anxious glances at the sky. "Those clouds
are traveling pretty fast and there's considerable
ripple on the water. There'll be something
doing before morning."</p>

<p>"Rain?" asked Mrs. Crane, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Wind," said the Captain, "but there may
be rain, too."</p>

<p>"If that's the case, we'd better get those
tents up at once," said Mr. Black, "and then
we shan't care if it does rain. We have five
tents and plenty of blankets."</p>

<p>"Well," offered Captain Berry, "if you've
five tents to put up, I guess I'd better help
you; but you mustn't keep me too long."</p>

<p>Fortunately, poles and stakes came with the
tents and the ground in the grassy clearing
was level. Soon, with valuable assistance from
Dave, a large octagonal tent of gaily striped
canvas was in place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Black, viewing it with satisfaction,
"is our dining-room."</p>

<p>Next, the three men hurriedly put up a
large, straight-walled sleeping tent that looked
very clean and new.</p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Black, wiping the perspiration
from his brow, "is for you five girls&mdash;you'll
have room for your bed and space
enough to dress in."</p>

<p>Of the remaining tents, one was for Mrs.
Crane, another for Mr. Black, and the third was
for the provisions. As soon as the tents were
up, and good Captain Berry was chug-chugging
away as fast as he could in his very much
lightened launch, there was plenty of work for
all hands to do. Provisions were placed under
cover, fresh balsam beds were arranged in the
three sleeping tents&mdash;Dave brought the boughs
and made the beds&mdash;and the girls stored their
bundles of clothing in their big bedroom.</p>

<p>In addition to garments for their charges, the
three mothers, Marjory's Aunty Jane, and
Henrietta's grandmother had sent large baskets
of delightful things to eat. Mrs. Slater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
had sent two roasted chickens, some bread, a
huge frosted cake, and some oranges; besides
all the things for which Henrietta had asked.
Mrs. Mapes had dispatched bread, doughnuts,
and three gigantic apple pies. Mrs. Bennett's
contributions were some fine home-made rolls,
a large veal loaf, a big box of cookies, besides
a huge basket of bananas for her daughter
Mabel. Aunty Jane had sent four kinds of
pickles, four kinds of jelly, four kinds of jam,
and a large beefsteak. Mrs. Tucker had added
a large jar of baked beans, a generous salad,
and two big pans of gingerbread.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Mrs. Crane, almost overwhelmed
with these contributions to her pantry,
"we won't have to use the flour, the yeast
cakes, and the tin oven I sent for, just yet
awhile."</p>

<p>"Nor the potatoes, canned things, and other
provisions that <i>I</i> ordered," said Mr. Black.
"We're certainly bountifully supplied with
food."</p>

<p>"We'll have a ready-made supper to-night,"
promised Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you'll wait half an hour," said Mr.
Black, "we'll have a table to eat it on. Now
that I have nails and a saw, we can have real
furniture."</p>

<p>Dave and Mr. Black made not only a table
but four benches, each long enough to hold
four persons. The table had to have a hole
in the center to accommodate the tent pole;
but Mr. Black managed that. Then he fastened
two lamps with reflectors to the pole,
Mrs. Crane spread a big sheet of white oil-cloth
over the table, and the dining-room was
complete.</p>

<p>Jean begged a number of wooden boxes from
which the contents had been removed. "We
can put our extra clothes in them," said she,
"and keep our toilet articles on top. I'm so
glad to have a hairbrush that I feel as if I
ought to frame it."</p>

<p>"Anything more to build?" asked Mr.
Black.</p>

<p>"I'd like a cupboard for my dishes," said
Mrs. Crane, who was setting the attractive
table. "But you needn't make it to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
It's a good thing the plates came&mdash;our wooden
ones wouldn't have stood another washing.
And I'm glad to have a dishpan."</p>

<p>"Wasn't the lake big enough?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't in the right place. Where's
Dave? He seems to think he belongs to us.
Hadn't we better give him some supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If you'll put something on a plate
I'll carry it to him&mdash;he's gone to his wigwam.
I want to tell him that we took his venison
and potatoes. Here, that's enough&mdash;I can't
carry <i>three</i> plates."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>A Stormy Night</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>EVERY one had been too busy to think
about the weather. But, when supper
was on the table, Mrs. Crane noticed that
Jean's dark hair had been blown about her face,
that Henrietta's, too, was flying about in loose
locks, and that the loose canvas at the doorway
of the big tent was flapping noisily.</p>

<p>"Look at the lake!" cried Marjory. "It's
all mussed up and queer, like something <i>boiling</i>.
I hope Captain Berry got home safely."</p>

<p>"The wind is in his favor and he has had
sufficient time. But that's a pretty angry sea&mdash;I
guess Dave and I had better pull those
boats to the top of the bank, after supper.
We're going to have some waves that <i>are</i> waves
before morning."</p>

<p>The lake, at that hour, however, was not so
rough as it was threatening. Its surface was
of a dark, dull slate-color, marked with long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
lines of deep blue and blackish purple. Some
hidden force seemed to be lifting it from underneath
as if, as Marjory said, it were boiling,
or at least getting ready to boil. The sun
had dropped behind the distant hills without
leaving the usual rose-pink afterglow. Overhead,
dark clouds were scurrying toward the
southwest; but as yet the waves had not gathered
sufficient strength to be very noisy. The
air was colder; and that, too, seemed filled
with hidden threats and half-whispered
warnings.</p>

<p>"I'm thankful," said Mr. Black, carving
more roasted chicken for Bettie, who said that
all fowls <i>should</i> have had eight legs apiece,
"that we have good, sound tents to sleep in
to-night and that Captain Berry knew how to
put them up so they'd stay. After we've pulled
the boat up, Dave and I will see if any of the
ropes need tightening. There is one thing that
everybody must remember. If it rains, you
must not touch the canvas&mdash;that makes it leak."</p>

<p>It was too windy for a fire on the beach
that night, so the castaways, in their warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sweaters, sat round the dining-room table, and,
by the light of the big lamps enjoyed the
magazines that Mr. Saunders had thoughtfully
included. They were particularly interested in
the advertisements of tents, boats, and other
camp-y things.</p>

<p>Just as Bettie was certain that her eyes
would not stay open a single moment longer,
there was a loud crash near at hand.</p>

<p>"Now what?" cried startled Mrs. Crane,
who was hemming some of the queer dish-toweling
that inexperienced Mr. Saunders had
been obliged to select, "is that? Not thunder,
I hope."</p>

<p>"Our late residence, I suspect," returned
Mr. Black. "It's a good thing we moved out
when we did&mdash;I guess I'd better rescue that
tablecloth."</p>

<p>By this time the waves were running high
and dashing savagely against the bank. Usually
the hurrying clouds obscured the moon;
but, whenever it gleamed forth for a moment,
it showed a foaming, furious sea&mdash;their calm,
beautiful, softly tinted lake was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad," shuddered Bettie, "that I'm
not out there in a boat."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Jean, "that nobody is. A
little boat would be smashed to bits."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be dreadful," suggested Henrietta,
"if a ship were wrecked right down
there on the beach? Anyway, I guess we'd
find it pretty exciting."</p>

<p>"Or the ship would," offered Marjory.</p>

<p>"Let's hope <i>hard</i>," said Bettie, "that all the
ships and sailors are in snug, safe harbors&mdash;When
I go to bed to-night I'm going to make
a little prayer about it."</p>

<p>But, in spite of Bettie's little prayer, if, indeed,
she remembered to make it, there were
several ships abroad that night; and a passenger
on one of the smallest and least significant
was probably, at that very moment,
sailing into this story; but many other things
happened before he was unceremoniously tumbled
into the tale; and you must have them
in their turn.</p>

<p>All night long the heavy surf pounded and
thundered on the beach. All night long the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wind howled and shrieked. But the castaways,
snug in their strong new tents and their
warm, red blankets, slept through all the turmoil.</p>

<p>They were obliged, next morning, to forego
the pleasure of washing their faces in the lake;
but the river, with some help from the bright
new dishpan, served as well. Dave's ice-cold
spring provided them with excellent drinking
water.</p>

<p>"This storm," said Mr. Black, arranging a
temporary shelter for the fire, "will bring us
plenty of driftwood. We can have benches
under the trees and an extra table or two&mdash;I
expect to get thin, building things."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't hurt you," returned Mrs.
Crane. "You can begin by building that fire&mdash;I'm
ready to cook."</p>

<p>Previously to this time, the days had been
warm and comparatively quiet; but to-day it
was decidedly cold. The wind, sweeping
through the clearing, carried off all the bits
of paper and string that the eager girls had
torn from their parcels the night before and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
thoughtlessly scattered about. It was necessary
to fasten things down to keep them from
swirling out of sight. The big waves still
thundered in and their white spray dashed high
above the edge of the battered bank.</p>

<p>But, for all that, it proved a delightful day,
because the clear air was wonderfully bracing,
the campers were really camping, and one could
escape the buffeting of the wind and the continuous
roar of the waves by taking long walks
in the sheltered trails and roads.</p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Black, when the morning's
work was done, "would be a good time
to walk to Barclay's Point to see the waves.
These are just tiny wavelets beside what we'll
see over there&mdash;they'll be perfectly terrific on
the north side of that peninsula. I <i>was</i> going
to fish in the river with those nice angleworms
that Saunders sent; but I can take you
there first and do my fishing afterwards."</p>

<p>There were two ways of getting to Barclay's
Point. In ordinary weather, one walked up
the beach. In stormy weather, there was a
very roundabout way by the road and a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
direct route by a woodsy trail that wasn't exactly
visible&mdash;one <i>felt</i> rather than saw it.
Some persons have an instinct for following
trails. Jean had it, Marjory had it to a lesser
degree; but Mabel and Henrietta were without
it; while Dave, Indian that he was, could see
trails where none existed for any one else.
Since Jean possessed the trail-instinct, she
walked ahead, while Mr. Black, in order to
keep Mabel and Henrietta from straying from
the path, marched behind. Mrs. Crane remained
in camp with Bettie, who was not yet
permitted to take long walks.</p>

<p>To reach Barclay's, one crossed the river
twice. The first crossing was easy, for there
was a rude bridge built of heavy timber. But
the second was a different matter. Nature
had provided a bridge by conveniently dropping
a huge tree across the stream, which was
wide and about three feet deep at this point.
The log&mdash;the branches had long ago been
chopped away&mdash;was very wide at one end but
tapered somewhat toward the other. When
the water was low, there was room for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
canoe to pass under this log. Jean walked
steadily across it, Marjory flitted over it like
a bird, Henrietta, with fancy steps that would
have been impossible for the others even on
solid ground, danced across; but Mabel, wavering
and wabbling, had to be assisted by Mr.
Black, who stretched forth a helping hand the
moment she began to falter.</p>

<p>"I guess," declared Mabel, indignantly,
"that old tree was a slippery elm."</p>

<p>"No," returned Mr. Black, "it was pine,
and a big fellow at that. It's been here for
many years."</p>

<p>"How can you tell?" queried Henrietta.</p>

<p>"See that birch tree growing from the upper
side of its root? That birch has had time
to grow from a seed into a good-sized tree since
some mighty tornado or some unusual freshet
uprooted this great pine&mdash;pine does not rot as
quickly as some of the harder woods."</p>

<p>"I see one reason why it fell," asserted
Jean. "There's water bubbling out down
there, under the root."</p>

<p>"So there is," said Mr. Black. "I'm glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I brought my cup&mdash;that's a spring. We'll have
a drink."</p>

<p>So everybody drank some of the clear, cold
water before proceeding to Barclay's.</p>

<p>There was no sign of civilization at Barclay's
Point; just a long, rocky promontory
that ran out into the lake and, in fair weather,
furnished a fine place to fish from. Its north
coast was particularly rough and jagged.
Here, as Mr. Blank had prophesied, the waves,
roaring and booming like ceaseless artillery,
struck with tremendous force against the rocks
and dashed to prodigious heights&mdash;a grand and
unforgettable sight.</p>

<p>But Mabel's sweater was not unforgettable.
She had taken it off because she was too warm
after the steep climb to the spot from which
the waves presented the finest spectacle (nobody
wanted to get <i>too</i> close to all that mountain
of water) and anchored the garment
firmly to the ground by means of a heavy
stone. She returned to camp without missing
it&mdash;she had something more exciting to think
of, for Henrietta had mentioned that one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the contributions from her grandmother was
a large box of candy.</p>

<p>"We'll have some," promised Henrietta,
"as soon as we get back to camp."</p>

<p>Naturally Mabel, who was inordinately fond
of sweet things and who had had no candy
for a week, forgot all about her gray sweater,
so near the color of the rocks that nobody else
noticed it. But, notwithstanding the discomfort
she endured without it, she was glad
afterwards that she <i>had</i> forgotten it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>Dry Clothes for Five</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>INSPIRED by the prospect of candy, Mabel
was eager for the campward trail. This
trail was wide and clearly marked near
Barclay's, so Mabel ran gaily ahead; but the
others followed closely at her heels&mdash;it was too
windy for much lingering on that exposed
shore.</p>

<p>Mabel, with just one thought in her head,
started heedlessly to run across the log that
spanned the river. If a squirrel hadn't started
at the same moment from the other end, Mabel
might have rushed safely across. But, startled
by the sudden, affrighted chattering of the surprised
squirrel, Mabel stopped, staggered,
swayed, and began to clutch wildly for support.
She found it in the scarlet necktie of
Henrietta's blouse.</p>

<p>Henrietta, clutched by the throat, as it were,
seized Mabel with one hand and Marjory with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the other in order to sustain her own suddenly
disturbed balance. For a moment, all three
swayed uncertainly. Then, there was a mighty
splash. All three were gone!</p>

<p>The disturbed river bottom sent up bubbles
of mud, a hand, a foot, then a bedraggled hair
ribbon. Mr. Black, followed by courageous
Jean, plunged to the rescue. In a moment, they
had all three of the struggling, half-strangled
girls on their feet. As the river bottom was
of the softest of mud, no one was hurt; but
the rescuers as well as the rescued were completely
drenched.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Mabel," said Mr. Black,
wiping that subdued young person's dripping
countenance with his own wet handkerchief,
"you'll have this whole camp drowned if you
don't look out. After this, you're to stick to
solid earth. I'm in earnest about this, Mabel.
You're not to attempt to cross this log again,
unless I'm with you."</p>

<p>"You were here <i>this</i> time," complained the
dripping culprit.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing I was. Jean would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
had a fine time fishing the three of you out
of that mud. Now, we'll just wade across here
where it isn't so deep&mdash;we can't get any wetter
than we are&mdash;and race home before we begin to
feel cold."</p>

<p>They raced as well as they could, in clinging
garments and water-soaked shoes; but they
presented a curious sight as they trailed into
the clearing. Mrs. Crane and Bettie advanced
eagerly to greet them.</p>

<p>"Company!" warned Bettie, running ahead.
"Two young men that drove up in a buckboard
to spend the day fishing in our river&mdash;Mr.
Saunders sent some letters by them. Thought
I'd tell you so you could prink a little, Henrietta&mdash;my
goodness! What's happened?"</p>

<p>"I've been fishing in the river myself," explained
Mr. Black, "and this is what I caught&mdash;three
very much speckled trout."</p>

<p>"My land!" exclaimed Mrs. Crane.
"What an awful mess!"</p>

<p>"It's just mud," said Marjory. "A few
of us landed head first in several inches of it.
It was Mabel, of course, that pulled us in&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fell off the big log on the trail to Barclay's."</p>

<p>"Well, you're certainly a sight," laughed
Bettie, turning back with her friends. "I don't
know which of you looks worst."</p>

<p>"They <i>all</i> do," groaned Mrs. Crane. "And
here was I just telling those two young men
that we had with us as pretty a lot of children
as they'd find in the state!"</p>

<p>The young men, seated on one of the
benches, looked at the "pretty lot of children."
Then, throwing back their heads, they
laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"We knew there were fish in the river," said
one of the visitors, "but we hadn't been told
about your mermaids."</p>

<p>"I've caught two lots this spring," said Mr.
Black, "but this is my largest&mdash;and, I hope, my
last&mdash;haul. This sort of fishing is hard on
my limited wardrobe."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Crane, "these shivering
scarecrows must get out of their wet garments
at once. Here, Jean, you and Henrietta
may dress in my tent&mdash;I'll bring your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
clothes. And, girls, throw all your wet garments
outside&mdash;don't drop them on the blankets."</p>

<p>The visitors declined an invitation to dinner,
as they had brought an ample lunch; but before
departing they helped Mrs. Crane stretch a
long clothesline between two trees in the
clearing.</p>

<p>"These things <i>should</i> be washed," said Mrs.
Crane, fastening the garments to the line with
all the safety pins the camp afforded, "but
we can't use the lake just now and it's a little
too far to a place that is just the right depth
in the river."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Bettie, helpfully,
"most of the mud will brush off when the
things are dry."</p>

<p>"The sand will, anyway. I hope those girls
can find enough clothes to put on."</p>

<p>"They have the ones they came in," said
Bettie, "and Jean's bundle was extra large."</p>

<p>The active castaways, clothed in dry garments,
spent a busy if not particularly exciting
afternoon exploring the trails that led from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the clearing. They gathered flowers, mushrooms,
firewood, birch bark, moss, ferns, and
even a few wild strawberries. Dave, who was
mysterious in his comings and goings, taught
them how to make willow whistles and promised
to show them some day how to catch
chipmunks.</p>

<p>"I think," said Jean, when the campers had
assembled for supper, "that this camp should
have a name. We might call it 'Camp Comfort.'"</p>

<p>"Everybody that <i>has</i> a camp," objected Mr.
Black, "calls it that. Let's have something
truly poetic."</p>

<p>"We might," suggested Henrietta, "name it
the Black Basin."</p>

<p>"That," demurred Bettie, "seems awfully
pirate-y. Bob has a book about pirates that
used to hide in a cave called the 'Black Basin'&mdash;I'd
be afraid to go to bed nights in a Black
Basin."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," offered Henrietta, "'The
Crane's Cove' would sound safer."</p>

<p>"That doesn't work right," protested Marjory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
wiggling her small pink tongue comically.
"I'd always be saying 'Crane's Crove.'"</p>

<p>"Besides," said Jean, "that isn't romantic
enough. We want something like 'Lover's
Leap,' or 'Breezy Bluff,' or 'River's Rest.'"</p>

<p>Just then Dave approached with an offering
for Jean&mdash;he had already given her his best
willow whistle and a partridge wing. This
time it was a fine speckled trout, bigger than
any that Mr. Black had been able to hook.</p>

<p>"Where'd you catch him?" asked Mr. Black.</p>

<p>Dave shrugged his shoulders and replied
evasively: "Pretty goo' fishin' groun' here at
'Pete's Patch.'"</p>

<p>"Where's Pete's Patch?" demanded Mr.
Black, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Right here," replied Dave, with a gesture
that included Mr. Black's entire property.
"He name after you&mdash;Ah name heem maself."</p>

<p>"That's nerve for you," breathed Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Pete's Patch!" murmured Mr. Black, who
seemed decidedly taken aback. "Pete's
Patch!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the surprised gentleman caught Bettie's
dancing eye and suddenly choked.</p>

<p>"What a lovely name," teased impish Henrietta.
"So romantic! So poetic! I'm glad
I came to Pete's Patch&mdash;I think I'll have to
write some verses about it&mdash;something like this,
for instance:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"If a trout or two you'd catch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or of mushrooms like a batch&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If a taste of heaven you'd snatch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hie away unto Pete's Patch."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"That's pretty bad," laughed Bettie, "but
it goes pretty well with the name."</p>

<p>Of course the name stuck. Mr. Black tried
a number of times to think of a more suitable
or finer sounding name for his beautiful lakeside
camp, but Dave's title was there to stay,
so the amused castaways had to make the best
of "Pete's Patch."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Peter," Mrs. Crane would
say, "it's a nice place, anyway; and the name
goes very well with our birch-bark stationery."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>Mabel's Astonishing Discovery</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE campers rose the next morning without
suspecting that a very strange thing
was about to happen; or that Mabel, who was
still in disgrace because of her habit of half
drowning her trusting companions, was, on
that never-to-be-forgotten day, as they say in
books, to cover herself with glory&mdash;instead of
mud.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Pete's Patch rose to find
the sun shining, the wind gone, the lake settled
back in its proper place.</p>

<p>"The sea began to subside before I turned
in last night," said Mr. Black. "It's as gentle
as a lamb to-day."</p>

<p>"Look at the shore!" cried Marjory. "It's
different. The beach that was sandy before the
storm is all pebbly now; and down there where
the cobblestones were it's all beautiful, smooth
sand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"And look," supplemented Jean, "at the
mouth of that surprising river. It's a lot wider
than it was when we came."</p>

<p>"Some time to-day," said Mr. Black, "I
want to go to the little cove about halfway
between here and Barclay's Point. That seems
to be the spot that catches everything that is
cast up by the sea. I need some thin boards
for your cupboard, Sarah. I noticed the other
day that the sharp cleft in the rocks back of
that cove was filled with boards."</p>

<p>"That's an awfully interesting spot," said
Jean. "If sailors threw bottles overboard
with letters in them, that's where you'd find
them&mdash;everything washes in at that spot."</p>

<p>"Or," said Henrietta, "if the captain
lashed his only daughter to the mast and threw
her overboard, that's where she'd land."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>hope</i> not," breathed tender-hearted
Bettie.</p>

<p>"So do I," laughed Henrietta, with an impish
glance at Mr. Black. "Think of being
wrecked on the reef of Pete's Patch!"</p>

<p>"Norman's Woe certainly sounds better,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
agreed Mr. Black, "but let us hope that no
one got wrecked <i>any</i> place. Now I must take
a look at the Whale&mdash;I'm wondering how she
weathered the storm."</p>

<p>"It's my turn to wash dishes," announced
Jean.</p>

<p>"And mine to wipe," said Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Then Bettie and I will do the beds," said
Marjory, quickly.</p>

<p>Mabel, left out in the cold, scowled darkly
for a moment. Then she sat up very stiffly indeed.</p>

<p>"I shall go all by myself and pick up two
big baskets of driftwood," said she.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," offered sympathetic
Jean, "you're invited to do dishes with
me, Mabel."</p>

<p>"And beds with me," added impish Henrietta.</p>

<p>"And to wash potatoes with me," teased
Marjory.</p>

<p>"Why not let me do <i>all</i> the work?" queried
Mabel, huffily. "But I <i>will</i> do dishes with
you, Jean. I know <i>you</i> meant to be polite."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Mabel, with two of the big baskets
that had come with the provisions, slid down
the sand bank to the beach. It was certainly a
fine morning. Within two minutes, sturdy
Mabel had forgotten that the others were
paired off and that she was the odd one.</p>

<p>"The sky is blue, blue, blue," sang Mabel,
marching up the smooth, hard beach; "the
water is blue, blue, blue with golden sparkles;
and the air is warm enough and cool enough
and clean, clean, cle&mdash;ow!"</p>

<p>A leisurely wave had crept in and made a
playful dash for Mabel's heedless feet.</p>

<p>"You got me that time," beamed friendly
Mabel. "I guess you wanted to remind me
that I was out after wood. All right, Mr.
Lake, I'll walk closer to the bank. My! What
nice little blocks for our fire. I <i>love</i> to find
things."</p>

<p>Soon both baskets were filled; but by this
time Mabel was well out of sight of the camp,
having passed two of the little rocky points
that extended into the lake, north of Pete's
Patch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had a hundred baskets to fill,"
sighed Mabel. "I guess I'll leave these right
here and go a little farther; it's such a nice
day and I <i>love</i> to go adventuring. Oh! I
know what I'll do; I'll go to Barclay's Point
after my sweater&mdash;I hope it hasn't blown
away."</p>

<p>So Mabel, with a definite object in view,
started at a brisker pace toward Barclay's.
Presently she reached the cove mentioned by
Mr. Black as a catch-all for floating timber.
The water was deeper at this place and a strong
current carried quantities of driftwood to this
wide, bowl-shaped cove. In severe storms,
some of it was tossed high among the rocks
and gnarled roots in a ravine-like cleft at the
back. Nearer the water, many great logs, partially
embedded in the sand, caught and held
the lighter material tossed in by the waves.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Mabel, "I wish I had a <i>million</i>
baskets! I know what I'll do. I'll just
toss a lot of those go-in-a-basket pieces into
a big pile way up there where the waves can't
get them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Gathering up the edges of her skirt, sturdy
Mabel filled it with the clean, if not particularly
dry, bits of wood, worn satin-smooth and
white by long buffetings against graveled
shores.</p>

<p>"I'll throw them behind that log," decided
Mabel, toiling inland with her heavy burden.
"They'll be perfectly safe up there&mdash;My! But
they're pretty heavy. I guess there's room
back of that big log for a whole wag&mdash;wow!
ow!"</p>

<p>Mabel's final syllable was a curious, startled
sound. While not precisely a gasp, a shriek,
or a shout, it was a queer combination of all
three.</p>

<p>Mabel was startled, and with good reason.
The space behind the log was already occupied;
and by something that looked human.</p>

<p>The surprised little girl saw first a pair of
water-soaked shoes attached to two very thin,
boyish legs in black stockings. Beyond the
stockings was a gray mass of tangled fish-net
wound about something bulky and white that
Mabel concluded was a life-preserver. Beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that, an extended arm was partly buried in the
sand. A thin, white hand was firmly closed
over a sharply projecting point of rock. Very
close against the huge log, so close as to be
almost under it, was a shining, golden ball, the
back of a boy's close-cropped head.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i143.jpg" width="310" height="500" alt="Mabel finding boy behind log" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The space behind the log was already occupied</span></div>
</div>

<p>For a long moment Mabel, who had unconsciously
dropped her load on her own toes,
stood still and gazed questioningly at her unexpected
find. Then the astonished little adventurer
climbed over the wood she had
dropped, bent down, and, with one finger,
touched the boy's stocking, gingerly.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if he'd been here very long," she said,
sagely, "his stockings would have been faded.
Things fade pretty fast on the lake shore.
Perhaps if I poke him he'll wake up."</p>

<p>Mabel prodded the unfaded legs very gently
with a pointed stick. There was no response.</p>

<p>"I guess he's dead," she sighed. "But I
s'pose I ought to feel his pulse to find out for
sure&mdash;ugh! I sort of hate to&mdash;suppose he <i>is</i>
dead!"</p>

<p>But, bravely overcoming her distaste for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
obvious duty, Mabel laid a trembling finger on
the slim white hand. It was not as cold and
clammy as she had feared to find it. Mabel
touched it again, this time with several fingers.
Yes, the hand was actually a little bit
warm.</p>

<p>As she bent closer to the golden head, it
seemed to Mabel that she could detect a sound
of breathing, rather heavy breathing, Mabel
thought; a little like Mrs. Crane's, when that
good lady snored.</p>

<p>Mabel crouched patiently near the prostrate
lad and listened. The labored breathing certainly
came from that recumbent boy.</p>

<p>"But," argued Mabel, "if he's only taking
a nap, why is he all tangled up in that net?
And there's that life-preserver. He's been
wrecked and tossed up, I believe. And he's
still all wet underneath. Perhaps I ought to
wake him up&mdash;he ought not to sleep in such
wet clothes."</p>

<p>So Mabel grasped her discovery very firmly
by one thin shoulder and shook him quite vigorously;
but he still slept. Then, clutching him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
by both shoulders, she succeeded in dragging
the heavy sleeper a few inches from the log;
but he seemed rather too firmly anchored to
his resting-place for this method to work successfully.
Still, she had gained something,
for now one ear and a bit of one cheek were
visible. They were not white like the extended
hand, but darkly red and very hot to the touch.</p>

<p>"Boy!" called Mabel. "Why don't you
wake up? Don't you know that you're not
drowned? Wake up, I say! Whoo! Whoo!
<i>Whoo!</i>"</p>

<p>But the boy, in spite of what should have
proved alarming sounds, made, as they were,
in his very ear, still slumbered on in a strange,
baffling fashion; and Mabel, after watching
him in a puzzled way for several moments
longer, found a broad shingle, which she balanced
neatly on the boy's unconscious head.</p>

<p>"That'll keep the sun off," said she, "while
I'm gone for help."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>Breaking the News</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"I &nbsp;WONDER," said Marjory, who, perched
on the edge of the bank, was shaking
the sand from a dried bathing suit, "what's
happened to Mabel. She's running down the
beach like mad. And calling! I guess she
wants somebody."</p>

<p>"If <i>you'd</i> keep quiet," suggested Henrietta,
"perhaps you could hear what she says."</p>

<p>"It's 'Mr. Bla-a-a-a-a-ack!'" mimicked
Marjory.</p>

<p>Mabel was breathless by the time she reached
the foot of the steep sand bank, just below
the camp.</p>

<p>"Oh," she panted. "Mr. Black&mdash;get him,
quick. And, Jean, <i>you</i> come. And, Mrs. Crane&mdash;scissors!
I <i>must</i> have scissors. Phew!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet a moment," advised motherly
Mrs. Crane, from the bank. "Sit right down
where you are and rest till you get your breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Marjory, you're the quickest&mdash;you run for Mr.
Black; he's just started for the wigwam to see
if he can find Dave. Jean, I'll trust <i>you</i> with
my scissors; but I'm going to tie them to you
with a piece of string. There! Now we'll
go down to Mabel.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Crane, when that stout
lady had made a careful descent of the sandy
bank, "tell us exactly what's happened, Mabel."</p>

<p>"It's a boy!" panted Mabel, "and he isn't
dead."</p>

<p>"Most boys aren't," encouraged Bettie, who
had a large number of lively brothers. "Go
on, Mabel."</p>

<p>"I found him on the beach."</p>

<p>"Well," scoffed Henrietta, "I guess a boy
on a beach isn't anything so wonderful."</p>

<p>"How did he get there?" queried Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>"Washed up, I guess. I thought he was
drowned. He's <i>most</i> dead."</p>

<p>"Where? Where?" shrieked Henrietta,
with sudden interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where? Where?" echoed Bettie.</p>

<p>Just then Marjory flung herself breathlessly
over the edge of the bank with Mr. Black,
also short of breath, close at her heels.</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" demanded Mr.
Black. "Has Mabel fallen in again?"</p>

<p>"Get the bread-knife, somebody," ordered
Mabel, now sufficiently recovered to scramble
to her feet, "and follow me."</p>

<p>"I have a knife," said Mr. Black, displaying
as bloodthirsty a bit of cutlery as one would
want to see. "Saunders thought I might need
a hunting knife. If you've caught a deer I'll
skin him for you."</p>

<p>"I guess," laughed Bettie, "she doesn't
want her game <i>skinned</i>. She's found a boy."</p>

<p>Presently the procession, headed proudly by
Mabel, who now felt very important indeed
and would allow none of her impatient followers
to pass her, was marching up the beach.
She was, however, too breathless for speed.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you go a <i>little</i> faster?" pleaded
Marjory.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't," panted Mabel. "And, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
you run ahead of me, you won't know where
to turn off&mdash;so there."</p>

<p>"Tell us more about it," begged Henrietta.
"I've always been crazy to rescue a shipwrecked
crew!"</p>

<p>"No," said Mabel, "I want my breath to
walk with."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the beach was smooth and hard;
the excited campers soon reached the cove.
Mabel, thoughtfully pausing long enough for
Mrs. Crane and Bettie to catch up, led them
to the big, half-buried log.</p>

<p>"There!" said she, pointing to what was
behind it. "That's the boy."</p>

<p>Bettie, Marjory, and Henrietta peered
eagerly over the log. Jean, Mrs. Crane, and
Mr. Black hurried behind it. Mr. Black
whipped out his knife, dropped to his knees,
and began to cut at the mesh of the stout net.
After a moment Jean assisted with the scissors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane patted the boy's hand and laid
her own motherly palm against his cheek.</p>

<p>"Poor lamb! Poor lamb!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Presently the lad was freed from the net<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and the life-preserver and gently lifted from
the wet wreckage to the warm, dry sand. His
eyes were closed, his breathing jerky and
strange, his whole countenance deeply flushed.
Big tears rolled down Mabel's cheeks as she
looked at the limp, pathetic figure.</p>

<p>"That boy," said Mrs. Crane, "is terribly
ill with a fever. Goodness only knows how
long he's been imprisoned here, chilled and
shivering, before this fever came on."</p>

<p>"Or just when the waves flung him behind
that log," said Mr. Black. "It might have
been early last night, any time yesterday, or
even during the previous night. He was lashed
to something with that net&mdash;yes, here it is;
a piece of rotten pole as thick as my arm&mdash;possibly
a mast or part of a raft. But what
concerns us just now is what we're to do for
him."</p>

<p>"He's certainly a sick boy," agreed Mrs.
Crane, "and there's nobody but us to help
him."</p>

<p>"Mabel," said Mr. Black, "you'd better take
off his shoes&mdash;he'll be lighter without them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Sarah, you'd better hurry back to camp and
fix a bed for him in your tent. Jean, you go
with her, build a fire, and put some water on
to boil&mdash;a little hot broth might help. If you
other girls will boost him a little, when I say
the word, I think I can carry him."</p>

<p>The girls boosted. Mr. Black, with the long,
thin boy hanging limply over his shoulder,
started toward camp. Mabel, a wet shoe dangling
from each hand, plodded after.</p>

<p>"Isn't it exciting?" breathed bright-eyed
Henrietta, falling into line. "A boy right out
of the skies."</p>

<p>"I guess you mean right out of the lake,"
corrected Marjory. "I hope he'll wake up
pretty soon&mdash;I'm dying to know how he got
behind that log."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was a good thing," said Bettie,
"that the log was there. The end of that pole
swung under the log and held him right there,
or the waves might have carried him out again
or hurled him against the rocks&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p>"His father," declared Henrietta, dreamily,
"was the captain of a gallant ship. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
vessel was about to sink he said: 'Men! Save
yourselves. As for me, I perish with her.'
Then he lashed his only son to the mast of
the sinking ship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded practical Marjory.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe he didn't," amended Henrietta,
reflectively. "He made a raft out of one
of the hatches and tied him to that with the
only thing he had at hand&mdash;a fish-net."</p>

<p>"But first," added Marjory, "he fastened
a life-preserver about him."</p>

<p>"If I could run the way I used to," said
thoughtful little Betty (this was the longest
walk she had taken since her arrival at Pete's
Patch), "I'd rush ahead and help Mrs. Crane
with that bed. As it is, I'm willing to help
with one of the baskets we're coming to&mdash;I
guess Mabel's forgotten all about them."</p>

<p>"I'll help Mrs. Crane," promised nimble-footed
Marjory, "if you and Henrietta will
bring the wood&mdash;they may need it for the fire
that Jean is to build."</p>

<p>Mr. Black undressed the thin, still-unconscious
lad, wrapped him in a warm blanket (his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
feet, Mrs. Crane said, were like lumps of ice),
and tucked him into bed.</p>

<p>"If we were in town," declared Mrs. Crane,
"I'd send for the doctor."</p>

<p>"Just what I'm going to do, as soon as
Dave turns up. I'll go to his wigwam now&mdash;perhaps
he's back. Too bad there isn't any medicine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there is," said Mrs. Crane. "Mrs.
Tucker sent a bottle to Bettie to be used in
case her fever should return. She sent a
tonic, too, but neither bottle has been opened.
If you think it's safe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good for Mrs. Tucker! Give that boy a
dose of the fever medicine&mdash;he certainly needs
that. Now for Dave&mdash;I'd like to get him
started for Lakeville at once."</p>

<p>Dave, however, was not to be found. His
ways were strange and mysterious; he had an
inconvenient habit of disappearing without
warning for hours at a stretch. No one would
see him go. He would set out, ostensibly for
his wigwam; but if Mr. Black followed him
to that habitation, as he sometimes did, no sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
would he find of Dave. This time, the canoe
was gone, also, and, of course, Dave's dog.</p>

<p>"He hasn't shown up," said Mr. Black, returning
from the wigwam. "I suppose he rose
at daybreak and took to the lake; for his canoe
isn't in the river. And here I am <i>paying</i> him
to bring water and wood for us and help with
the boats."</p>

<p>"Paying him!" gasped Mrs. Crane, "when
he lived on your land for four years without
paying rent? <i>Peter!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mr. Black, "it's only a
dollar a day. Perhaps that isn't enough&mdash;I'll
raise his wages!"</p>

<p>"But that poor boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll just have to wait until Dave gets
back, I suppose. But you can dose the boy
with Bettie's fever medicine&mdash;not the tonic&mdash;and
perhaps we can pull him through."</p>

<p>"Anyway, we'll try," assured Mrs. Crane.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A Missing Messenger</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IT was Thursday when Mabel discovered the
boy. Friday morning Dave was still missing
and the lad was still unconscious.</p>

<p>"He must have been a pretty tough little
chap to start with," declared Mrs. Crane, when
all the members of her always-hungry family
had been bountifully served with steaming
breakfast food, "or he never would have lasted
as long as this with such a fever. I wish
Dave was here. He ought to have a doctor;
and, if the boy's people live in Lakeville, they'll
surely want to know that he's alive."</p>

<p>"We've been talking about that," said Jean,
"and we don't think he <i>is</i> a Lakeville
boy."</p>

<p>"You see," explained Marjory, "he must
be about twelve or thirteen years old&mdash;somewhere
between Mabel's age and Henrietta's.
If he'd been in school one or another of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
would have seen him&mdash;we're scattered all over,
you know."</p>

<p>"And I," said Henrietta, "am scattered
about in <i>all</i> the grades, because I'm so smart
and so stupid in spots."</p>

<p>"But perhaps," suggested Mr. Black, "this
illness has altered his appearance."</p>

<p>"It couldn't change his hair," asserted Mabel.
"It's a very queer color."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Crane, "it's a most unusual
shade&mdash;very bright and glistening like
ruddy gold. There's a tinge of copper to it
and yet it's golden. If only Dave were
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I could walk to Lakeville myself," began
Mr. Black, reflectively, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you're not going to," protested his
sister. "We can't stay here without a man.
Besides, if anything happened to you on the
way down, where should <i>we</i> be?"</p>

<p>"At Pete's Patch, I suspect," twinkled Mr.
Black. "Suppose you give that boy some hot
sponge baths&mdash;that may help a little."</p>

<p>"But, goodness!" objected Mabel, "he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
be perfectly soaked with water&mdash;his clothes
were drenched."</p>

<p>"Still," said Mr. Black, "baths are beneficial
to fever patients."</p>

<p>"I've been putting mild mustard plasters on
his chest," confessed anxious Mrs. Crane. "I
didn't like his breathing&mdash;it sounded too much
like pneumonia yesterday; but it's a bit better
to-day. And I'll try those baths."</p>

<p>"I haven't much faith in your mustard plasters,"
asserted Mr. Black, teasingly. "You're
too tender-hearted to make one strong enough
to do any good."</p>

<p>"I'm not," retorted Mrs. Crane; "but
there's no sense in blistering folks."</p>

<p>"I'm glad there's a really sick person in this
camp," said Bettie, "because now, perhaps, I
can persuade you to believe that I'm most as
well as ever. I had two long walks yesterday
and I feel just fine to-day."</p>

<p>"Did you sleep well?" queried Mrs. Crane,
anxiously. "I declare, with all this excitement,
I forgot to ask you."</p>

<p>"Only five minutes," said Bettie, in a sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
tone. "I shut my eyes at eight o'clock
last night and when I opened them it was only
five minutes after eight."</p>

<p>"Last night?" pursued Mrs. Crane, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, this morning," replied Bettie, demurely,
"but the clock <i>said</i> five minutes, and it
didn't <i>seem</i> like any more than that."</p>

<p>Among the many things that Mrs. Crane
had ordered from town was a truly alarming
alarm clock. Although it went off faithfully
and with astonishing vigor at seven every
morning, no one ever heard it after the first
day except Mrs. Crane. The campers, never
very early risers, grew lazier every day&mdash;and
fatter! Mabel, always exceedingly plump, was
now so rotund that Mrs. Crane was obliged to
tie loops of twine in all her buttonholes. Bettie's
cheeks and the calves of her legs were certainly
rounding into new and pleasing curves.
Tall Jean was casting a wider shadow, shapely
Henrietta had punched two new holes in her
tight leather belt; and it was now possible to
pinch the hitherto unpinchable Marjory. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
complexions, too, had undergone curious
changes. Mabel had gained a generous sprinkling
of very fine, very dark freckles. Marjory's
blue-white skin was dotted with a limited
number of very large, pale tan-colored
freckles. Henrietta was tinged a rich even
brown, except where a fine red glowed in her
dark cheeks. Most of the time Jean was a
brilliant scarlet; for her tender skin burned
easily and her nose, as Bettie said, was disreputably
ragged, for it peeled every day or
two. So did the edges of her ears. As for
Bettie, her yellowish pallor was gone and a
fine, rose-colored flush now tinged her lips and
her cheeks. Her big, dark eyes were brighter
and merrier than the girls had ever seen them.</p>

<p>"Another ten days in camp," asserted Mr.
Black, pinching Bettie's firm cheek, "and
you'll all be wearing Mrs. Crane's clothes.
Your own mothers won't know you by the
time we're ready to go home."</p>

<p>"They won't want to," laughed Marjory,
"if we all gain as Mabel has. Look at her
back!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>It was really a shockingly untidy back, because
bits of Mabel and Mabel's underwear
stuck out between the loops.</p>

<p>"She drinks so much water," complained
Henrietta, "that my arm just aches from filling
her cup."</p>

<p>"Put the pail beside her," suggested Mr.
Black. "Water's the one thing that can't give
out."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Mrs. Crane, "we'll
need a lot of things by the time Dave goes
to town again. My list is growing bigger
every minute."</p>

<p>"Like Mabel," breathed Marjory, teasingly.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Mabel&mdash;and the sigh burst
two of her loops&mdash;"I shall ask for a very
wide sailor-jumper to pull on over my head.
The knots in those loops are pretty bumpy.
If I were to sneeze, they'd <i>all</i> go, I guess."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane, of course, appropriated most
of the care of the newest castaway. But the
willing girls helped in many ways.</p>

<p>"They are my feet," said slow-moving,
stiff-jointed Mrs. Crane. "They bring me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
everything I need and save me hundreds of
steps every day. They're all as good as gold,
Peter."</p>

<p>"They're <i>better</i>," declared Mr. Black. "I
wish they all belonged to <i>me</i>&mdash;anyway, we'll
enjoy 'em while we can."</p>

<p>Sometimes one or another of the girls was
permitted to sit beside the sleeping boy for half
an hour, while Mrs. Crane busied herself with
the camp cooking&mdash;no one else, the good lady
was certain, could plan the meals; but nursing
proved rather an uninteresting task, because
there was really nothing that one could do.
The girls found cooking rather more to their
taste and were able to relieve Mrs. Crane of
many of her culinary burdens. Jean, however,
was the only one who could fry the fine brook
trout that Mr. Black sometimes caught in the
attractive river.</p>

<p>"They're all right after they're cooked,"
shuddered Marjory, that afternoon, when Mr.
Black brought in a pretty string of fish, cleaned
and ready to fry, "but I <i>couldn't</i> touch a raw
one&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither could I," said Henrietta, "but Anthony
Fitz-Hubert could&mdash;see, he's just crazy
for one this minute."</p>

<p>"Here's one with his name on it," said Mr.
Black, presenting the little cat with a small
specimen. "That one is under-sized, so it
wouldn't do for <i>us</i> to be caught with it; but
they couldn't arrest or fine Anthony, because
he's too active and too poor. How would you
girls like to try fishing?"</p>

<p>"We'd like it," responded Henrietta.
"Once, when I was very small, I went fishing
in Scotland, in a little rushing river; and once,
in France, a little peasant boy let me hold his
rod for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Well," promised Mr. Black, "some day
I'll take you all fishing. After you've caught
a trout or two you won't mind handling them.
But just now I can't afford to be reckless with
the bait&mdash;we'll get a bigger supply next time."</p>

<p>"I've heard it said," laughed Mrs. Crane,
"that there's a stingy streak in everybody, if
you know just where to look for it; we've
found yours, Peter; it's fish-worms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, they're mighty scarce in this part
of the country. I dug for nearly an hour
along the river bank and found only one. I'll
send word to Martin, next time, and have him
dig a pailful in our garden."</p>

<p>"He'll dig up everything else, too," sighed
Mrs. Crane, "but never mind. But that reminds
me of Dave. Marjory, I wish you and
Henrietta would see if that rascal has slipped
in by some back way to his wigwam. I declare
I never thought that I'd <i>want</i> to set eyes
on that homely half-breed, but I'd give a dollar,
this very minute, to see him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane, however, was not called on to
part with her dollar. The messengers returned
without Dave.</p>

<p>"Not a single sign of him," said Henrietta,
"and we called until all the little squirrels sat
up and scolded us for making such a noise."</p>

<p>"He's out for venison, I fear," said Mr.
Black, who was counting his seven precious
fish-worms. "He has no regard whatever for
the game laws. I shall give him a good talking
to when he returns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better wait," suggested Mrs. Crane,
"until after he's been to Lakeville."</p>

<p>"You'd better wait," laughed saucy Henrietta,
"until you see him."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Mr. Black, "we must all
remember to stand between Dave and the game
warden, if that officer ever visits Pete's Patch."</p>

<p>"No really respectable game warden,"
laughed Henrietta, "would ever visit a camp
with a name like that."</p>

<p>"That's a nice name," championed Mabel.
"It's plain and sensible like Mr. Black. I <i>like</i>
things that are plain and sort of&mdash;homely."</p>

<p>At this, everybody (including Mr. Black,
who might easily have been much homelier
than he was) laughed merrily; for Mabel,
cheerful little blunderer, usually managed to
give a queer twist to her compliments.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Mabel, rather huffily, "I
<i>meant</i> to be polite."</p>

<p>"You <i>were</i>," assured Mr. Black, patting the
hunched shoulder, "because it's our meaning
that counts; and we all know that you meant
well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," queried Jean, "if Dave does?"</p>

<p>"I fear," returned Mr. Black, "that the
workings of that rascal's mind would be pretty
hard to follow&mdash;let's see if his boat is in
sight."</p>

<p>But it wasn't, so Mr. Black got the wood
and the water that he was paying Dave to
bring and arranged the evening bonfire.</p>

<p>And the sick boy, in spite of the young
campers' impatience to learn his story, still
slept. Mrs. Crane, by this time, was almost
sure that he would never waken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>Doctor Dave</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>AT daybreak the next morning the barking
of a dog wakened the sleeping camp. Mr.
Black pulled on his clothes and went sleepily
down to the water's edge, where Onota,
Dave's yellow dog, was running madly about,
uttering excited yelps.</p>

<p>"Heem glad for got home," explained Dave,
who had beached his canoe and was gathering
up its contents.</p>

<p>"What have you got?" asked Mr. Black.</p>

<p>Dave displayed a small doe, not yet skinned.</p>

<p>"Dose bigges' one&mdash;som' beeg buck, Ah'm
t'ink&mdash;she ees bus' up ma trap," Dave complained,
"so Ah'm snare dose li'le doe. He
ees good meat, all right."</p>

<p>"Dave, you scalawag, you ought to be in
jail. I'll wager there isn't a game law that
you haven't broken."</p>

<p>"He ees mos' all for you," assured Dave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ingratiatingly. "You got fine dinner off heem
ver' soon&mdash;I skeen heem for you, bam-bye.
She's good meat, dose young-lady deer."</p>

<p>"I <i>ought</i> to tell the game warden on you.
Don't you <i>know</i> that you're breaking game
laws?"</p>

<p>"Ah'm t'ink maybe Ah'm crack dose law
som'," admitted Dave; "but me, Ah mus' eat
li'le deer meat som' tam', halso dose par<i>tridge</i>,
maybe som' duck, too."</p>

<p>"Well," warned Mr. Black, helplessly,
"don't expect me to help you out if you get
caught. And now, Dave, I wish you'd stay
right here for awhile; I've got a job for you.
I want you to go to Lakeville to-day&mdash;we've
a sick boy up there and we need a doctor."</p>

<p>"Seeck boy?" queried Dave. "W'ere you
got her from? W'at she ees seeck on herself
wit'?"</p>

<p>Mr. Black explained.</p>

<p>"Dat's all right," Dave said. "Bad cold on
her long (lung). Ah cook you som't'ing w'at
feex her pooty good."</p>

<p>"No, no," protested Mr. Black, "we want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a doctor and a lot of other things. You <i>must</i>
go to Lakeville. I'll&mdash;yes, I'll give you two
dollars."</p>

<p>"Maybe Ah go behind dinner," promised
Dave, uncertainly. "Ah mus' sleep, me, for
two-t'ree hour&mdash;Ah'm chase dose deer hall
night. Tell dose Jean, dose Bet<i>tee</i>, dose Mabelle,
and dose Henriette, eef he ees com' roun'
pooty soon, Ah show heem how to skeen dose
deer."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that his medical
services had been declined, Dave began almost
at once to search for herbs, dig for roots, and
gather certain pungent leaves and twigs.
These he covered carefully with water and
placed over a slow fire in a most repulsive
saucepan. By half-past eight o'clock, by which
time the castaways were eating breakfast, Dave
had obtained about half a pint of a queer-smelling,
most unattractive-looking, greenish-black
fluid. He carried this strange brew carefully
to the clearing, peered cautiously into
Mrs. Crane's unguarded tent, entered noiselessly,
and dropped the flap. Then, kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
beside the helpless lad, the half-breed raised
him gently and poured the contents of his
blackened tin cup, a little at a time, down the
boy's throat. This accomplished successfully,
Dave, much pleased with himself, emerged
just in time to meet startled Mrs. Crane, returning
to look at her charge.</p>

<p>"Dave," she shrieked, noting the empty, not
over-clean cup, "what <i>have</i> you done?"</p>

<p>"Das all right, Mees Crane," assured Dave.
"Dose boy, she swallow good. Ev'rybody
wait fi&mdash;seex hour. Dose boy sweat lak' horse
bam-bye&mdash;wake up weak like babee&mdash;open hees
eye. Maybe she's dead then, maybe she's get
well. You geeve her queek som' brot'&mdash;bouillon&mdash;w'at
you call heem&mdash;soup, hey?&mdash;behin'
dos beeg sweat. For mak' her strong,
dose seeck boy."</p>

<p>"Dave," moaned Mrs. Crane, who had
seized the cup and was smelling it, "you've
surely killed that poor child!"</p>

<p>"Nong, nong," protested Dave. "Dose ees
ver' goo' medicine&mdash;Ah'm got her off ma gran'modder."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," growled Mr. Black, finding it difficult
to be stern, with five amused little girls
giggling at his back. "If you get any more
medicine off your grandmother I'll throw you
into the lake."</p>

<p>"Hee ees been dead long tam'&mdash;dose gran'modder."</p>

<p>"Took her own medicine, I suppose," said
Mr. Black. "Was she French or Indian?"</p>

<p>"Ojibway; som' squaw&mdash;som' Injun lady;
ma fadaire, he French, from Canadaw&mdash;speak
no Englise. Ma modder Injun, sam' lak ma
gran'modder; he mak' dose medicine, too.
Bot' dead, dose fadaire, dose modder."</p>

<p>"No wonder," breathed Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Mees Bet<i>tee</i>," said Dave, turning to go,
"you breeng dose odder girl&mdash;Ah show you
how to skeen som' deer. Maybe Ah'm geeve
you dose tail. Dose liver&mdash;vaire fine meat,
dose liver&mdash;ees for Jean."</p>

<p>At this the girls found it hard not to laugh
outright, because, as they very well knew, Jean
heartily disliked liver of any kind. But gentle-mannered
Jean, who was always careful not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hurt any other person's feelings, managed to
say, prettily:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dave; you're very good to
me."</p>

<p>"You pooty nice girl," returned Dave.
"Ah mak' som' med'cine for dose sunburn
hon your face."</p>

<p>"Thank you," faltered Jean, "but I&mdash;but I
<i>like</i> to be sunburned. I'll be such a fine color
after I've lost <i>all</i> my skin."</p>

<p>"Dear me," groaned Mrs. Crane, when the
girls had trooped away at Dave's heels, "I was
almost sure, this morning, that that boy was
better. I put my hand on his forehead very
early&mdash;when Dave's dog barked, and it felt
cool and even a little damp&mdash;as if the fever
had left him for just a moment or two. And
now Dave has probably finished him. That
boy must have had a fine constitution to start
with or that fever would have ended him yesterday.
That horrible medicine on top of
everything else he's gone through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mr. Black, "we won't
gain anything by worrying about it. We'll get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Dave started after a real doctor as soon as
possible&mdash;I'll write a note to Doctor Bennett,
so he can bring the proper medicines with him.
Make out your list and put the girls at theirs
as soon as they return&mdash;I'll go after them presently.
That rascal said he'd start 'behind
dinner.'"</p>

<p>It was considerably "behind" the noon meal
when Dave was ready to begin his long walk;
but at last, with a little food tied in a soiled red
handkerchief that dangled from a stick resting
on his shoulder, he departed. Although Dave
never looked particularly clean, although he
was not especially handsome, there were moments
when, because of his picturesqueness, he
decidedly pleased the eye. Now, with the
touch of dangling scarlet at his back, all the
rest of him except his rather long black hair
an even, woodsy brown, Dave and the landscape,
harmoniously combined, made a truly
attractive picture. But not for long. The
leaves at the edge of the grassy clearing closed
suddenly behind him; the castaways could not
discover his trail; but Dave must have guessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that they were trying to find it, for his laugh,
always an unexpectedly musical sound, floated
back to the searchers.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Jean, "that he won't be gone
as long <i>this</i> time. Mrs. Crane is almost as
worried about this boy as she was about Rosa
Marie with the measles&mdash;perhaps more, because
she had the doctor to help her then."</p>

<p>"Dave helped her this time," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> hope he'll hurry, too," returned Henrietta.
"It seems a <i>year</i> since I ate the last
crumb of candy out of my box."</p>

<p>"And we can't make any," mourned Marjory,
"because the sugar's all but gone."</p>

<p>"There's only a little butter," added Bettie,
"and less than half a loaf of rye bread; but
luckily we've plenty of flour and cornmeal.
Biscuits and johnny-cake help a lot."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing," said Mabel, "that Mrs.
Crane thought of sending for that old tin
oven. I'd hate to be obliged to go hungry with
the kind of appetite I've got <i>now</i>. I believe
I could eat raw potatoes this minute."</p>

<p>"You won't have to," assured Jean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
"There's plenty of oatmeal and rice and a lot
of things in packages. Oh, yes, and <i>beans</i>&mdash;a
great big bag of dried ones."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be nice," suggested Bettie, "to
surprise Mr. Black and Mrs. Crane with baked
beans for supper!"</p>

<p>"But they'd see us cooking them," objected
Jean.</p>

<p>"We could build a stone oven, the way Dave
showed us, on the beach," said practical Bettie.
"Of course, if we used the tin one here in
the clearing, they'd see what we were doing.
Marjory, you're so small they won't notice
you, so you slip into the provision tent and
get the beans. How many? Why&mdash;I don't
know."</p>

<p>"Seven hundred," said Henrietta, promptly.
"A hundred apiece&mdash;Anthony prefers fish-tails."</p>

<p>"I guess," protested Marjory, "I'm not going
to <i>count</i> those beans&mdash;they come in <i>pounds</i>,
not dozens."</p>

<p>"They swell a lot," said Bettie. "I think
that about four cupfuls would be enough&mdash;bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
them down in one of those round pudding
pans&mdash;we'll bake 'em in that."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Jean, when Marjory
had successfully captured the beans, "that we
ought to wash them. But we haven't any
colander&mdash;one of those things with holes in
it."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Henrietta, "we'll use
the lake&mdash;it's big enough, anyway. I'll wade
in with the beans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess not," retorted Mabel. "Your feet
and beans all in together!"</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Henrietta. "Well,
we'll dig out a basin in the hard clean sand
and wash them in that."</p>

<p>The basin grew larger than the girls meant
to make it, and the slippery white beans, turned
loose in this little pond, proved remarkably
elusive. But finally the last one was captured
and placed in a pan of water with a pinch of
salt; the pan was placed in the oven that the
girls had built, and a fire was started under it.</p>

<p>"They'll be surprised, won't they?" giggled
the happy conspirators, far from suspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that they themselves were to be the surprised
persons; for this was their first experience
with cooking dried beans, and of
course, since they couldn't consult Mrs. Crane
without betraying the secret, there was no one
to ask for very necessary instructions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>A Valuable Insect</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MRS. CRANE remained very near her
sleeping charge all that day. She didn't
see, she said, how anybody <i>could</i> survive the
dreadful dose that Dave had poured down the
unconscious lad's throat.</p>

<p>At four that afternoon one of Dave's predictions
came true. Great beads of perspiration
broke out on the boy's forehead; and soon
the voluminous nightgown in which Mrs.
Crane had arrayed the patient was wet through,
for he was indeed "sweating like a horse."</p>

<p>Remembering Dave's advice concerning
broth, yet decidedly fearful of following advice
from so doubtful a source, the anxious
nurse searched her cupboard for the little jar
of beef extract that had been ordered for Bettie
(by this time Bettie was clamoring for&mdash;and
getting&mdash;more substantial food) and made a
small bowlful of strong <i>bouillon</i>. But first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
careful Mrs. Crane wrapped her patient in a
warm blanket.</p>

<p>When she returned with the broth, intending
to force it by spoonfuls into the lad's
mouth, she realised that a great change had
taken place in her patient. The fever flush
was gone from his cheeks, leaving him pale
and clammy; but now, for the first time since
his arrival in Pete's Patch his eyes were open.
They were big and very, very blue.</p>

<p>"Well," greeted Mrs. Crane, "this is something
like! Awake, are you? Don't be frightened,
poor lamb&mdash;you're as safe here as if you
were in your own bed. Open your mouth,
there's a good boy. It's some time since you've
had a Christian meal."</p>

<p>After the first few spoonfuls, the boy's eyes
closed wearily; but he still opened his mouth
obediently, just like a young robin, his pleased
nurse said afterwards.</p>

<p>"That's all," announced Mrs. Crane, giving
him the last spoonful. "Now go to sleep if
you want to."</p>

<p>Apparently he did want to, for that is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
he did. Mrs. Crane stole softly from the tent.</p>

<p>"Girls," said she, to the little group in the
shade of the biggest tree, "I want you to be
very quiet whenever you come near the tents&mdash;tell
the others when they come back. I believe
that boy has taken a change for the better&mdash;he's
lost his fever and he's sleeping like a
baby."</p>

<p>"Was it Dave's awful medicine?" queried
Bettie.</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Mrs. Crane.
"Your bottle probably helped. I don't suppose
we'll <i>ever</i> know just what effect Dave's
potion had; but <i>something</i> has certainly
brought about a change in that poor child.
Anyway, remember not to make a noise near
my tent."</p>

<p>"My!" giggled Marjory, when Mrs. Crane
had returned to her charge, "she never even
<i>looked</i> toward the beach. I was <i>so</i> afraid she'd
notice the smoke from that fire and ask what
Jean and Mabel were doing."</p>

<p>"So was I," said Henrietta, who was endeavoring
to weave a basket from some long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fragrant grass that she had discovered in a
marsh near the river, "but she doesn't think
of anything but that boy."</p>

<p>"What's Mr. Black doing all this time?"
asked Bettie, who was lying at full length on
the ground with her head in Marjory's lap.</p>

<p>"Fishing with his two and a half worms,"
replied Henrietta.</p>

<p>"There he comes now," said Marjory, "but
what in the world ails him?"</p>

<p>No wonder she asked, for stout Mr. Black,
hatless and coatless, his thick, iron-gray hair
standing upright, his oft-mended suspenders
broken once more and dangling from his waist,
was dashing madly about the further end of
the clearing. Now with arms aloft, now with
fingers gripping the sod, this usually sedate and
dignified gentleman was behaving in a most
remarkable manner.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" gasped Henrietta. "He must
be doing an Indian war-dance!"</p>

<p>"He's pounding the ground with his hat,"
said Marjory.</p>

<p>"Now he's trying to fly&mdash;mercy! He's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
tripped right over a stump!" exclaimed Henrietta.
"Let's go and see what he's doing."</p>

<p>Just then Jean and Mabel clambered up the
bank from the beach. On seeing the others
fleeing hurriedly in Mr. Black's direction, they,
too, scurried after.</p>

<p>"He got away," panted Mr. Black, ruefully,
as he picked himself up from the grass plot.</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Marjory, "a squirrel? a
rabbit? a beaver?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Mr. Black, rather sheepishly,
wiping his perspiring brow, "a grasshopper.
But I must have that beast. Girls,
I'll give you a dollar apiece for every grasshopper
you can catch within the next ten minutes.
You see, I accidentally caught one&mdash;the
thing was down my neck&mdash;put it on my hook,
and in two seconds it was snatched off by
the biggest trout I've seen in six years! Yes,
siree! He was a yard long! I'd pay <i>two</i>
dollars for another grasshopper this minute;
for <i>I</i> can't catch the pesky things."</p>

<p>"Easy money," laughed Henrietta. "Come
on, girls. Let's see who'll get the two dollars."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>In another moment all five were hurling
themselves recklessly about the sunny clearing,
wherever a grasshopper jumped. To an unenlightened
observer, it must have seemed as if
they, too, were doing an Indian war-dance;
certainly they alarmed the grasshoppers.</p>

<p>"Oh," gasped Bettie, after five minutes of
this strenuous exercise, "I can't try any longer&mdash;my
poor old legs are all gone."</p>

<p>So tired Bettie nestled comfortably against
Mr. Black, who, with his broad back against
a stump, was resting as peacefully as the
thought of that big, uncaught trout would permit.
But the other four still chased grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a big, bewildered insect hopped
right into Bettie's lap; and, in a moment, Bettie's
quick, slender fingers had closed over as
fine a grasshopper as fisherman would wish
to see.</p>

<p>"I've got him&mdash;I've got him!" she shrieked.
"He's right in my hand."</p>

<p>Mr. Black placed the captive in his pocket
match-safe. Then gravely extracting a two-dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
bill from his trousers pocket, he dropped
it in Bettie's lap.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>," breathed Bettie. "Not when
you're so good to me&mdash;I'd catch a million
grasshoppers for you for nothing, if I only
could."</p>

<p>"If you don't keep it," declared Mr. Black,
closing her fingers over the bill, "I'll let that
precious insect fly away."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Bettie, stuffing the money
down her neck, "I'll sit here with my mouth
open and let grasshoppers fly in until I catch
a <i>truly</i> two dollars' worth."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Mr. Black, rising with difficulty,
"bring all you catch down that left-hand
trail to the second bend in the river&mdash;that's
where I saw that whale."</p>

<p>But there was no need of a second grasshopper;
for before another was captured, Mr.
Black, beaming with pleasure, rushed to the
clearing to display his trout. Although the
big fish lacked almost two feet of being a
yard long, he was a fine specimen.</p>

<p>"And Bettie's grasshopper," said Mr. Black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
readjusting it on his hook, "is still as good as
new, so I'm going back for another fish&mdash;with
one more, plus the three I caught this morning,
we'll have enough for supper."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" gasped Jean. "Our surprise&mdash;nobody's
watching the fire!"</p>

<p>With one accord, the five cooks rushed to
the beach.</p>

<p>"The fire's out," said Jean. "We'll have
to build it again."</p>

<p>When all the rest of the supper was on the
table, including Mr. Black's satisfactory catch
of trout, nicely fried by Jean, Marjory slipped
quietly away to extract the surprise from the
oven. She was not entirely satisfied with its
appearance; but, at any rate, the dish was good
and hot. She succeeded in getting it safely
up the sand bank and into the octagonal tent,
where she placed it triumphantly beside the
trout.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Mrs. Crane, whose patient
was still sleeping, "what have we here?"</p>

<p>"A surprise," beamed Mabel.</p>

<p>"Boston baked beans," explained Bettie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, that," said Mr. Black, "is a real
treat. There's nothing better than beans for
camp fare."</p>

<p>But when the beans were served they rattled,
as they touched the plates, like rain on
a tin roof. Instead of being smooth and nicely
filled out, each bean was shriveled and as hard
as a pebble.</p>

<p>"Dear me," mourned Bettie, who had taken
the first mouthful, "those are dreadful beans&mdash;I
can't bite them."</p>

<p>"But," said puzzled Jean, "they cooked for
hours."</p>

<p>"Did you soak them first?" asked Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>"No," replied Jean.</p>

<p>"Didn't you boil them?"</p>

<p>"No, we didn't do that, either. Just baked
'em."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," laughed Mrs. Crane. "No
wonder they're hard. You should have soaked
them all night, boiled them for an hour, and
<i>then</i> baked them. And I think, my dears, that
you forgot the pork, the molasses, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
salt&mdash;beans need a great deal of salt. But it
was nice and thoughtful of you good little
girls to go to all that trouble."</p>

<p>"We wanted it to be a lovely surprise,"
mourned Mabel.</p>

<p>"Well," teased Mr. Black, "it's certainly
more of a surprise than you meant it to be,
therefore more of a success, because we are <i>all</i>
surprised."</p>

<p>"Cheer up," said Mrs. Crane, touched by the
downcast countenances of the disappointed
cooks. "We'll feed the surprise to the squirrels.
After supper&mdash;you see there's plenty
this time <i>without</i> the surprise&mdash;we'll put some
more beans to soak; and to-morrow we'll cook
them the other way. Anyway, I'm very glad
you thought of cooking those beans&mdash;I'd forgotten
that we had them."</p>

<p>At this the seven gloomy faces brightened.
And the beans were not wasted; for the kind
squirrels carried away every one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>The Game Warden's Visit</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE boy was really better; but very, very
weak. Every time he opened an eye, that
next day, solicitous Mrs. Crane was ready with
a bowl of broth. Once he did not fall asleep
immediately but followed her with big, questioning
blue eyes as she moved about the tent.
He remained awake for twenty minutes that
time and even moved his hands slightly.</p>

<p>"You've been real sick," explained Mrs.
Crane, sociably, her soft dark eyes very kind
and encouraging. "You're pretty weak yet,
but you're twice the boy you were yesterday.
Could you eat more broth?"</p>

<p>For an instant something that looked like
a genuine smile flickered across the boy's lips;
and his eyes, Mrs. Crane said afterwards, almost
twinkled. Then, in a very thin, weak
voice, he said: "Please."</p>

<p>After that he again fell into a long, deep
sleep. But now his prolonged slumbers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
no longer terrifying, for his breathing was
natural, his fever entirely gone.</p>

<p>"<i>Can't</i> we see him next time his eyes are
open?" pleaded Mabel, waylaying Mrs. Crane
in the provision tent, "and <i>couldn't</i> I be the
first one? I found him, you know, so he's
really mostly mine."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," replied Mrs. Crane, pondering
this matter. "I guess it's only fair that you
should be the first. If you'll stay where you
can see the door of my tent, I'll wave a towel
when the time comes. But it won't be right
away, for he's just gone to sleep again."</p>

<p>"That boat ought to get here to-day," said
Mr. Black, who had been expectantly gazing
from time to time at the lake, "but I suppose
that rascal Dave stopped all along the way to
set traps."</p>

<p>Mr. Black was quite right. Dave <i>had</i>
stopped to set traps. But first of all, with
characteristic stealth, the conscienceless half-breed
had begun his journey with a comfortable
nap. For almost two hours, within five
minutes' walk of Pete's Patch, Dave had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
slumbered, with no thought of anything but
his own comfort. After that, he attended leisurely
to the numerous traps along his almost
invisible trail. Fortunately&mdash;or he might
<i>never</i> have reached his destination, he found
only a solitary muskrat. The big rat was still
living. Dave eyed him reflectively.</p>

<p>"Goo'-by, li'le son," said Dave, liberating the
bright-eyed prisoner. "You ees more bodder
dan you ees wort', to-day. An' w'at for Ah'm
eat moskrat! Me, Ah'm go for eat dose bifsteak,
dose pork shop, dose baked bean hon
top of Lakeveele. Go home, you son of a
moskrat&mdash;Ah catch you som' more nex' veek."</p>

<p>The limping rat splashed into the river, and
Dave, after one half-regretful glance at the
eddying water, at last started briskly along the
trail that led to Lakeville.</p>

<p>He spent the night with his cousin on the
outskirts of the town, who refreshed him so
generously that faithless Dave didn't know,
next morning, whether he was headed toward
Lakeville or toward camp. So he slept all that
day and the next; while his good friend Mabel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
at Pete's Patch, made brave efforts to save him
from threatened disaster.</p>

<p>Mabel and all the other girls knew that
Dave had every reason to fear the game warden.
The youthful castaways, who were not
very clear as to the duties of game wardens in
general, considered them the natural enemies
of all hunters and fishermen. Dave had once
shown the girls a battered, yellowed newspaper
containing a full-length picture of a
brawny, khaki-clad game warden arresting a
lawless sportsman. The half-breed had said,
half laughingly, half seriously:</p>

<p>"Eef you ees see dose man som' tam', Mees
Mabelle, Mees Bet<i>tee</i>, don't you go for tole
her som't'ing about Dave Gurneau, or maybe,
me, Ah'm got maself lock up for sure. Or
maybe Ah'm go for pay feefty dollar fine."</p>

<p>The idea of a fifty-dollar fine had probably
tickled Dave, who, at that poverty-stricken moment
would have found it impossible to pay
even fifty cents.</p>

<p>But the girls had been deeply impressed.
They saw clearly that a visit from the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
warden would result disastrously to Dave,
whom the youngsters liked, in spite of his
many irregularities; for the ignorant half-breed
was always good to them in his own
peculiar way. And then, too, Mr. Black had
said that Dave was to be protected from all
chance visitors.</p>

<p>Very soon after the arrival of the nails, Mr.
Black had built a rain-proof shed to shelter
the disabled "Whale." As it was possible
to reach this spot without tumbling into either
the lake or the river, Mabel often strolled that
way to look for berries, flowers, mushrooms,
or mosses&mdash;she was apt to return with specimens
of all four jumbled untidily together in
the skirt of her dress.</p>

<p>This fine morning, Mrs. Crane having suggested
that a few mushrooms would add flavor
and bulk to the noon meal, Mabel and Henrietta,
with the praiseworthy intention of gathering
a bushel or two, walked along the
swampy, woodsy road that led to Lakeville.</p>

<p>It was not often that Mabel and Henrietta
paired off together, for Henrietta was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
oldest, Mabel the youngest of the five girls.
But in some ways pretty, black-eyed Henrietta
was more thoughtless, less responsible than
Jean, Marjory, or Bettie. After the death of
her young mother, various relatives, including
an inexperienced father and a too-indulgent
grandmother, had done their best to spoil attractive
Henrietta. They hadn't exactly succeeded;
but the unrestrained little girl, naturally
impulsive, naturally a bit daring, and
always very high-spirited, was apt to act first
and do her thinking afterwards. As for Mabel&mdash;why,
Mabel simply <i>plunged</i> into trouble.
Still, it seemed safe enough to send this pair
forth for mushrooms; so, with a basket between
them, a smiling sky overhead, they set
forth merrily.</p>

<p>"It's funny about mushrooms," observed
Mabel. "You can gather all there are and
the next day you find just as many more. But
when you pick berries that's the last of them
for a whole year."</p>

<p>"I wish," returned Henrietta, "it were just
the other way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Mabel, her mouth full of
big, red wintergreen berries.</p>

<p>"It never is," sighed Henrietta, sentimentally.
"Every time there's a storm, the sea
brings in millions of cobblestones and only one
agate. I <i>love</i> to hunt for agates."</p>

<p>"If they came in like cobblestones," said
practical Mabel, "you wouldn't have the fun
of hunting&mdash;&mdash; Why! There's something
coming down the road. See! That way&mdash;toward
Lakeville."</p>

<p>"A man on horseback!" exclaimed Henrietta.
"Let's hide&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Mabel, bravely.</p>

<p>"His clothes!" breathed Henrietta, in an
agonized whisper, as she dragged Mabel backward.
"Can't you <i>see?</i> It's the game warden&mdash;I
know him by his leggings. Just like
that picture. Hurry, Mabel&mdash;he's after
Dave!"</p>

<p>"Oh! do you <i>think</i> so?" gasped Mabel,
paralyzed with horror. "And all that venison
hanging near Dave's wigwam! And all those
partridge feathers on Mr. Black's land! They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
might arrest him, too! And us! Oh, Henrietta!
What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"Run," urged Henrietta, tugging at Mabel's
dress.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I can't!" gasped Mabel, helplessly.
"And, anyway, it's too late&mdash;he's looking
right this way. But, oh! We mustn't let
him go anywhere near Pete's Patch."</p>

<p>"Sh!" breathed Henrietta, warningly; but
with a quick, decisive nod that seemed vaguely
reassuring. "Stop looking scared."</p>

<p>The rider, having cautiously and more or
less successfully skirted a bad bit of swamp,
caught sight of the girls and checked his travel-stained
horse.</p>

<p>"Is this the way," he asked, politely, "to
Barclay's Point?"</p>

<p>Henrietta's forefinger promptly pointed toward
the north&mdash;directly toward the concealed
Point.</p>

<p>"Just keep going," she advised. "It's
quite a long way, but you're headed right for
Barclay's."</p>

<p>"Yes," assisted Mabel, after a closer scrutiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the telltale leggings, "you just keep
going."</p>

<p>"I'm looking," explained the man, "for Mr.
Black. He's at Barclay's Point, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," replied Henrietta, truthfully.</p>

<p>"How's the fishing up there?"</p>

<p>"I haven't fished," returned Henrietta,
shortly. The game warden, it was plain, would
get no incriminating information from Henrietta.</p>

<p>"This road, you say, leads to the Point?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," faltered Mabel; "yes, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the 'if,'" hissed Henrietta,
into Mabel's surprised ear. "Yes," she added
aloud, and very convincingly, "it <i>does</i> lead to
the Point. But you'd better hurry, or Mr. Black
may be starting out for some other place."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to miss him," said the man, touching
his hat. "Thank you, young ladies. I'll
go at once&mdash;perhaps I'll see you later."</p>

<p>Mabel and Henrietta eyed each other in discreet
silence until the sound of hoofbeats had
gradually died away.</p>

<p>"We've been bad," breathed Mabel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was necessary," sighed Henrietta.
"Goodness knows, I'd <i>rather</i> be good. And
that road <i>does</i> lead to Barclay's Point."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you're smart enough to find the
turn off."</p>

<p>"That's why I told him to hurry&mdash;if he
rides fast, he'll <i>never</i> see it."</p>

<p>"Nobody would," agreed Mabel. "Where
does this road go, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen miles to an old lumber camp&mdash;Dave
told me. There's another camp, not so
far, but it has a 'blind turn-off'&mdash;you'd <i>never</i>
find it if you didn't know just exactly where to
look. Even then you'd <i>think</i> you were wrong.
I guess it'll take him all day to find Pete's
Patch. Anyhow, I hope so."</p>

<p>"Shall we tell the others?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," decided Henrietta, contemplatively.
"By the time he's reached the end of
that swampy road without coming to anything
he'll be too tired and discouraged to <i>want</i> to
arrest anybody. He'll just make tracks for
home. But when Dave comes we'll tell him to
hide his venison."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"And," said Mabel, not knowing the depths
of Dave's depravity, "he'll surely be here soon&mdash;he'll
hurry right back with my father."</p>

<p>"Why, that's so," laughed Henrietta.
"Your father <i>is</i> coming. Well, he won't know
you&mdash;he'll think you're some relative of
Dave's, and prescribe soap. But let's get those
mushrooms. If that man comes back he
mustn't find us here&mdash;he <i>might</i> ask questions
we couldn't answer. And I think we'd better
roll a log across the turn-off to Pete's Patch
and throw a little old brush against it so it
won't show."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>The Boy's Name</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>AN hour later, with a splendid lot of glistening
mushrooms, Mabel and Henrietta returned
to camp. As they neared the clearing,
Mrs. Crane could be seen in the doorway of
her tent, frantically waving a large towel.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Mabel, quickening her pace,
"the boy's awake! She wants <i>me</i>&mdash;I'm to be
first&mdash;I'm to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you plunge in that way," admonished
Henrietta, running lightly beside Mabel,
"you'll scare him to death. Do stop long
enough to wash your face&mdash;he'll think you're a
murderous young squaw coming with another
dose of Dave's medicine."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, when Mabel, very red
and very shining from a hasty application of
laundry soap and cold water, looked in at the
tent door, a pair of big, bright blue eyes smiled
at her from the low, balsam bed.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said the boy, "are you the kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they call Mabel? They tell me you picked me
up on the beach, along with some driftwood,
when I was drowned."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Mabel, bashfully. "And I
guess you <i>were</i> drowned, too&mdash;almost. I'm
glad you've come to, at last. When are you
going to get up?"</p>

<p>"I tried to just now, but my head's made
of lead&mdash;it won't come up."</p>

<p>"I guess your neck's weak&mdash;Bettie's was.
What's your name?"</p>

<p>The laughter and the light suddenly faded
from the boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the boy, blankly. "I&mdash;it's
queer, isn't it? That lady with the broth
asked me once before, I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I asked you yesterday," corroborated Mrs.
Crane. "But don't worry, my dear. You've
been very ill and your mind is as weak as your
body, no doubt. They'll both be stronger in
a few days. All you need to remember is that
we are your friends."</p>

<p>"And your real name doesn't matter, anyway,"
added Mabel, noting the troubled expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that still clouded the boy's countenance.
"I'm going to call you Billy Blue-eyes&mdash;I
used to know a goat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy's expressive face suddenly brightened,
the blue eyes actually twinkled with fun.</p>

<p>"The very thing," cried Mrs. Crane.
"We'll call him Billy Blue-eyes. I told him
this morning that, when he came out of the
lake, he must have brought some of the color
with him. His eyes are certainly blue. Shall
we call you Billy?"</p>

<p>"Sounds all right to me," agreed the boy;
"but&mdash;but I <i>hope</i> I wasn't that goat."</p>

<p>"You weren't," assured Mabel, earnestly.
"<i>I</i> liked him, but he butted so many people
that Grandma Pike&mdash;he belonged to her&mdash;had
to have him chloroformed and stuffed. The
stuffed-animal man wanted him. They didn't
have any real glass goat eyes to put in him so
they used blue glass marbles. But how did
you get in the lake&mdash;or out of it, Mr. Billy?"</p>

<p>Again the boy looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"Don't ask any more questions," warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Mrs. Crane. "There'll be plenty of time for
that later. Mr. Black sent a notice to the
Lakeville paper, by Dave, so his folks'll know
he's alive&mdash;we described him as well as we
could. I even measured him with my tape-measure.
He isn't as wide as he ought to be
for his length, poor lamb."</p>

<p>"He'll get fat on camp fare," promised Mabel.
"Look at me!"</p>

<p>Billy Blue-eyes looked and the troubled expression
gave way to one of amusement.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said he, "I'd better not be fed so
often&mdash;I guess I'll wait awhile for that broth&mdash;I've
only one suit of clothes, the broth lady
says. If I outgrow that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can borrow mine," laughed Mabel.
"My gray sweater would fit you splendidly."</p>

<p>"He'll need it, too," said Mrs. Crane,
"when he sits up to-morrow. That is, I <i>think</i>
I'll let him sit up to-morrow&mdash;he hasn't had
a scrap of fever for quite awhile."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Mabel, "Dave's medicine
really did cure him. Did you taste it,
Billy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once," said Billy, "but I don't know
when, I drank something like red-hot coals,
flavored with tobacco and vinegar and ink&mdash;was
that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Mabel, "that must have
been it."</p>

<p>"There's a queer taste in my mouth yet,"
declared the boy. "It's all puckered up&mdash;like
choke-cherries."</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better run along, Mabel,"
advised Mrs. Crane, noting that the boy's eyes,
in spite of his best efforts, were closing wearily.
"He doesn't stay awake very long at a time."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Mabel, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Come again," breathed the boy, sleepily.</p>

<p>Of course Mabel felt very important indeed
when the other youthful castaways, waiting
impatiently just outside the tent, seized her
and wanted to know all about it.</p>

<p>"He's awfully thin," said Mabel, condescending
finally to answer some of the eager
little girls' questions. "And his eyes are perfectly
huge and sort of twinkly. And blue;
yes, bluer than Marjory's. I think we're going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to like him; but he can't remember his own
name."</p>

<p>"Can't remember his own name!" exclaimed
Henrietta. "Perhaps he doesn't <i>want</i>
to. Perhaps he's an escaped convict trying to
hide from the police. Perhaps he's a burglar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He isn't either," snorted Mabel, indignantly.
"Do you s'pose I'd rescue anybody
like that? Besides, you can tell. He <i>wants</i>
to remember and can't."</p>

<p>"But what," demanded sympathetic Bettie,
"will that poor child do for a name? Are
we to call him 'that boy' forever? And shout
'Say, Boy' when we want him?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Henrietta, promptly.
"We'll name him ourselves. Vincent de Manville
Holmes would be nice&mdash;or Neptune something,
because he came out of the sea."</p>

<p>"That was Venus," corrected Jean.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," amended Henrietta, cheerfully,
"Ulysses might be better. Still, I always did
like Reginald. Or Percival&mdash;Percival Orlando
de Courcy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"You go home," blurted indignant Mabel,
no longer able to listen in triumphant silence.
"His name's Billy. He's my boy and I named
him; and that's enough."</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Marjory. "Just
Billy?"</p>

<p>"Billy Blue-eyes."</p>

<p>"My!" teased Marjory. "Just like a paper
doll!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," soothed tactful Jean, "I
think Billy's a beautiful name."</p>

<p>"For a goat," scoffed Henrietta.</p>

<p>There's no knowing what would have happened
if Mr. Black, gently shooing a strange
object before him, had not appeared just then,
from the woods back of the clearing.</p>

<p>"Hi there, girls," he shouted, "I'm bringing
you a pet!"</p>

<p>At that the girls, all differences forgotten,
raced toward Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" he shouted. "You'll scare
him away. Stand where you are. That's
right. Now, Marjory, you run for the clothesline&mdash;we'll
try to get a noose about his neck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness!" gasped Henrietta, backing
away as the pet waddled toward her; "what
is it? It looks just like a bad dream."</p>

<p>"I know," laughed Jean. "It's a porcupine.
Just see how his quills stick out&mdash;Mercy!
Look out, Bettie!"</p>

<p>"Ouch!" squealed short-skirted Bettie, as
the clumsy beast hurtled past her. "My legs!"</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Mabel, "there's quills in
your stockings!"</p>

<p>"In <i>me</i>, too," giggled Bettie. "I guess nobody'll
pet <i>that</i> pet very much."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we don't want him," said Mr.
Black, rather apologetically; "but I thought
you might enjoy studying a porcupine at close
quarters."</p>

<p>"Not <i>too</i> close," laughed Bettie, rubbing her
shin.</p>

<p>"They're easily tamed," said Mr. Black,
"and they'll eat most anything. I found this
one on the river bank. He seemed willing
enough to run, but it took quite a while to get
him going in the right direction."</p>

<p>Mr. Black succeeded presently in getting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
noose fastened about the porcupine's neck.
Then, because there happened to be a convenient
tree at that point, the other end of the
rope was made fast to a sturdy maple near
the path that led to the beach.</p>

<p>"We'll name <i>him</i> Percival Orlando de
Courcy," declared Henrietta.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Black, "this is Terrible
Tim, the watchdog. Stationed at this point,
he'll keep all intruders at bay."</p>

<p>Terrible Tim, however, looked the mildest
of beasts by this time, for with quills lowered,
he was cowering bashfully among the
shrubbery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A Belated Traveler</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp;BRILLIANT moon had aided Dave in
the latter portion of his journey to Lakeville.
The following night, a similarly illumined
sky was of great assistance to another
solitary wayfarer, for the man in leather leggings,
misdirected that morning by Mabel and
Henrietta, was laboriously making his way
back toward Pete's Patch. Before he had
<i>quite</i> reached the end of the unspeakable road
over which the girls had sent him, he had met
a camping fisherman who had given him explicit
directions for finding Mr. Black's land.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that night, having at last
reached Barclay's Point, he urged his patient
horse along the beach until he came to the
embers of a dying camp fire, and noted, on
the bank above, a number of white tents gleaming
like ghosts in the moonlight. Tying his
weary steed to a convenient log, the man, very
stiff and sore from his long ride, clambered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
up the sand bank, only to fall prone at the
top over a strange and most alarmingly prickly
object that stood directly in his path.</p>

<p>Rising with considerable difficulty and separating
himself as speedily as possible from
Terrible Tim, who was emitting queer, frightened
grunts, the surprised traveler moved cautiously
along the path, shouting, in a voice
that quavered persistently in spite of his manly
efforts to control it:</p>

<p>"Mr. Black! Oh, Mr. Bla&mdash;ack!"</p>

<p>Mr. Black, only half awake, sat up to listen.
The call came again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Bla-a-a-ack!"</p>

<p>The owner of the name, wrapped in a blanket,
thrust an inquiring head from the doorway
of his tent.</p>

<p>"What's all the row about?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oo!" groaned Henrietta, who had wakened
at the first call, "it's that game warden!
He'll never spare us <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>Keen-eared Marjory, too, was sitting up to
listen; and, at Mr. Black's reply, Jean and
Bettie opened their eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wake up," commanded Henrietta, in a
terrifying whisper, as she pummeled Mabel
mercilessly. "Wake up, wake up&mdash;the game
warden's here."</p>

<p>The response to this was so surprising that
Henrietta, whose teeth were already chattering
with fright, almost tumbled over.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;oop!" shouted Mabel, doubling up
her sturdy fists and hitting out, first with
one, then another. "Who&mdash;oop! Who&mdash;oop!
Who&mdash;oop!"</p>

<p>"Mabel! For goodness' sake, what do you
think you're doing!" gasped Henrietta. "Oh,
my poor chin!"</p>

<p>"Mabel! Stop pounding my ribs!" shrieked
Bettie. "You can't sleep next to <i>me</i> again."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I killed him," breathed Mabel, subsiding
with a deep, satisfied sigh. "Oh, is it
breakfast time?"</p>

<p>"What did you kill?" demanded Henrietta,
rubbing her chin.</p>

<p>"The father-bear&mdash;Bettie was running away
with his cubs. What's the matter with everybody?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"The game warden," whispered Henrietta.
"He's outside with Mr. Black&mdash;arresting him,
I guess. But listen&mdash;they're talking."</p>

<p>"What!" Mr. Black was exclaiming, excitedly.
"Two girls? Two of <i>my</i> girls sent
you&mdash;why, Saunders! You must be dreaming!"</p>

<p>"Saunders!" gasped Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Saunders!" echoed Mabel. "Why!
Saunders is the man in Mr. Black's office. I've
never seen him, but I've heard a lot about
him."</p>

<p>"Girls!" called Mr. Black, "are you
awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," shrieked all five.</p>

<p>"Here's a hungry man. Could one of you
roll up in a blanket and find him something
to eat?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" shrieked all five.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there followed a lively
scramble for shoes and blankets and, in another
moment, the five girls, looking like so
many disheveled little squaws, were out in the
moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's some cold johnny-cake," said Jean,
rather doubtfully, "and some mushroom soup
that I could warm up."</p>

<p>"And beans," added Marjory, stalking after
her towards the camp cupboard. "I'll get
the dishes."</p>

<p>"Girls," said Mr. Black, "this is Mr.
Saunders&mdash;Mr. William Saunders&mdash;of Lakeville.
Saunders, which of these young women
did you see this morning?"</p>

<p>"Well, really," stammered the visitor, glancing
from one to another of the blanketed
maidens, "I couldn't say."</p>

<p>"Mabel and me," mumbled Henrietta, half-heartedly.</p>

<p>"And you sent him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We thought," explained Mabel, balancing
unsteadily on the only foot for which she had
been able to find a shoe, "that he was the
game warden."</p>

<p>"Game warden!" gasped Mr. Black. "Do
you mean to say that you <i>meant</i> to send him
seventeen miles from Barclay's?"</p>

<p>The guilty little girls accomplished the difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
feat of nodding and hanging their heads
at the same time.</p>

<p>"In all that mud!" groaned Saunders,
"and on that awful saddle!"</p>

<p>"We," faltered Henrietta, whose red blanket
was most becoming to her sparkling brunette
countenance, "we didn't want the game
warden to find out about Dave."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Mr. Black.
"That reminds me. Dave is in Lakeville,
Saunders is here&mdash;he brought up an important
paper for me to sign. With Saunders gone,
Dave won't know what to do about the doctor.
He <i>may</i> start back."</p>

<p>"Not if there's anything drinkable left in
Lakeville," assured Saunders. "I know
mighty well where I'll find him. But I <i>can't</i> go
back to-night&mdash;I'm not accustomed to riding,
and I've been on that poor old nag all day."</p>

<p>"I'll fix a bed for you in my tent," said Mr.
Black. "There's plenty of room."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry for what we did," mumbled
Henrietta, contritely, "but we <i>did</i> mistake
you for that dreadful game warden."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"That looks," said Saunders, with mock
severity, "as if you'd been breaking the game
laws."</p>

<p>"It's that rascal Dave," explained Mr.
Black. "He has damaged them all; but please
don't mention it in town."</p>

<p>Mr. Saunders was fed and escorted to bed;
but before he had had time to unlace his shoes,
there were wild shrieks from the girls' tent.
Mabel, the first to plunge in, had collided with
a horribly prickly object that grunted like a
frightened pig and scratched like a thousand
needles. Then, as girl after girl rubbed against
Terrible Tim, who had somehow escaped and
was calmly eating their tallow candle, a chorus
of shrieks rang forth. This outcry, of course,
sent Mr. Black flying to the rescue. And
Mrs. Crane, roused at last and puzzled by the
presence of Mr. Saunders, joined the relief
party.</p>

<p>"It's Terrible Tim!" shrieked Marjory.
"He's in all our beds!"</p>

<p>"We'll let him go," declared Mr. Black.
"He's too troublesome a pet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, no!" shrieked the alarmed girls.
"He'll get in here again."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure," said Mrs. Crane, "that he
isn't wanted in <i>my</i> tent."</p>

<p>"Well," agreed Mr. Black, "I guess it <i>is</i>
wiser to tie him up than to attempt to chase
him away&mdash;perhaps he's forgotten the way
home."</p>

<p>So Terrible Tim, cowering in a corner and
quite as frightened as his victims, was fastened
to his clothesline and driven to his tree.
It was days, however, before the girls' blankets
were free from the irritating porcupine quills
that Timothy had shed so generously.</p>

<p>In the morning Mr. Saunders, still stiff and
sore from his long ride, was safely started on
his way to Lakeville; but, during his brief stay,
he had made friends with all the girls and
even conversed for a few moments with Billy
Blue-eyes, who was greatly taken with the
pleasant young man.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Saunders, with a
twinkle in his shrewd gray eye as he glanced
toward Mabel and Henrietta, "I want to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
such a good impression that I'll be recognized
a mile away <i>next</i> time."</p>

<p>"Well," complained Mabel, "you might
have <i>said</i> you weren't that game warden."</p>

<p>At that, lame as he was, Saunders threw
back his head and roared.</p>

<p>When Saunders, bountifully supplied with
lists and instructions, had departed, Mrs. Crane
told the girls that Billy was clamoring for
visitors.</p>

<p>"I guess," said she, "we'll let Jean and
Bettie in first&mdash;they're the quietest."</p>

<p>The boy was now visibly gaining in
strength; also he seemed sufficiently cheerful
and contented until Bettie, forgetting that she
was not to trouble him with questions, asked if
he lived in Lakeville.</p>

<p>"Where's that?" queried the boy.</p>

<p>"About fifteen miles from here," returned
Bettie. "You could see it on a clear day if
it wasn't for Sugar Loaf and a lot of other
scenery in the way."</p>

<p>"What's Sugar Loaf&mdash;sounds like a candy
shop?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very high hill right on the edge of the
lake. Lakeville is a town around several corners
in a little bay. Where <i>did</i> you come
from?"</p>

<p>The boy's eyes clouded. "I don't know,"
said he. "When I wake up in the night I
<i>almost</i> remember things&mdash;my bed, for instance,
belongs over there&mdash;but there's always a piece
of everything gone. I&mdash;it bothers me. I guess
you think I'm pretty queer."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," soothed Jean. "You're not
strong yet. You'll be all right when you're
well."</p>

<p>"Think so?" demanded Billy, brightening.
"Then I'll eat all the broth Mrs.&mdash;some kind
of a bird&mdash;brings me."</p>

<p>"She's making some now," said Bettie,
"from a piece of Dave's venison. We'll have
all sorts of good things to eat as soon as Mr.
Saunders gets to town. He said he'd travel as
fast as he <i>could</i>&mdash;I guess he's pretty lame."</p>

<p>"But," groaned Jean, "he can't possibly get
anything here before to-morrow and I'm just
starved for pie."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pie!" laughed the boy. "I'd like a piece
myself. Why, when I lived in&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash; Now
wouldn't that make you tired! I can <i>see</i> a
table with pie on it and a whole pitcher full
of cream; but, if you offered me a thousand
dollars I couldn't tell you where to find that
table! Pshaw! It makes me so mad when
things float off like that that I want to&mdash;cry."</p>

<p>Whereupon Jean, noting that big tears
blurred the blue eyes, began hastily to tell how
Terrible Tim had devoured one of Mabel's
shoes, left carelessly within his reach; and
presently the lad was again smiling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>A Surprise Party</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE following afternoon, all the castaways
except Billy, who, however, was
sitting up in bed, crouched in a row on
the bank to watch two slowly approaching
objects.</p>

<p>"Surely we never asked for <i>two</i> boat-loads
of food," remarked puzzled Bettie.</p>

<p>"Or medicine," added Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p>"Or books," said Jean.</p>

<p>"Or clothes," supplemented Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Mr. Black, "the other
boat isn't coming here."</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i>," asserted far-sighted Marjory.
"It's headed right this way. And the bigger
one is Captain Berry's launch, I <i>know</i>."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the boat that was <i>not</i>
Captain Berry's dropped anchor in the little
bay.</p>

<p>"It's people!" Marjory exclaimed, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
smaller launch swung about. "It looks like a
picnic."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said alarmed Mrs. Crane, "I
hope they've brought their own lunch&mdash;<i>we</i>
couldn't give them much. And I feel like hiding
in the woods&mdash;we're terribly in need of
starch and flatirons."</p>

<p>"They're <i>waving</i>," cried Bettie. "I do believe
they're visitors for us. Oh, I guess they
want a boat."</p>

<p>Mr. Black, who had hastened to the launch
with one of the small boats, was first to recognize
the passengers. Jean, who followed with
the second boat (by this time all the girls had
learned to row in the shallow, usually calm
little bay), was second.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed astonished Jean, almost
catching a crab, "it's most of our parents
and Aunty Jane&mdash;I do hope they're not
going to take us home!"</p>

<p>Presently the visitors were safely landed.
Doctor and Mrs. Bennett, Doctor and Mrs.
Tucker, Mrs. Mapes, Henrietta's grandmother,
Mrs. Slater, and Marjory's Aunty Jane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's that dreadful boy?" demanded
Aunty Jane, the moment she was on shore.
"Are you sure he hasn't something catching?
I haven't known a moment's peace since I
knew that you'd sent for the doctor; for Marjory's
never had <i>anything</i>. Are you sure it
isn't smallpox? Those lumber camps up the
lake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Crane, "didn't we
write that the boy was more than half
drowned? I'm <i>sure</i> I said so."</p>

<p>"It was that Indian&mdash;that unspeakably
filthy Indian," returned Aunty Jane. "He
said the boy had a fever. I went to the jail&mdash;to
the <i>jail</i>, Mrs. Crane&mdash;to talk to that&mdash;that
beast."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Dave?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. From what little I could
understand, I gathered that that boy had some
malignant illness&mdash;typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet
fever, smallpox&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Black," interposed Doctor Bennett, "I
did all I could to keep these women home, but
they <i>would</i> come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't blame them," beamed Mr. Black,
hospitably. "They wanted to see their girls.
We're glad to see you all."</p>

<p>Aunty Jane, the neatest housekeeper in
Lakeville, cast disapproving glances in every
direction as Mr. Black led the way to the campground.
Everybody else was busy exclaiming
over Bettie.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you <i>are</i> Bettie?" demanded
Mrs. Tucker, with delighted eyes. "Why,
you're <i>fat</i>&mdash;Doctor Bennett, she hasn't been
fat since she was three years old. And brown!
And look at the red in her cheeks! And her
lips!"</p>

<p>"I've certainly lost my patient," laughed
Doctor Bennett. "But Mabel seems to be all
here."</p>

<p>"Just look at my long Jean's brown arms,"
cried pleased Mrs. Mapes, vainly endeavoring
to span the rounded forearm. "Bigger than
mine!"</p>

<p>"That's muscle," laughed Jean. "Rowing
and climbing trees are great for your muscle&mdash;but
hard on your clothes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered Aunty Jane, sniffing disgustedly.
"How horrible everything smells!
Bacon, onions, fish&mdash;just like that filthy Indian!"</p>

<p>"All camps smell camp-y," explained Doctor
Bennett. "<i>You'll</i> smell camp-y after a day
in the woods. But where's that boy? Until I've
seen him, these anxious mothers won't be satisfied
that he hasn't something contagious."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mapes, Doctor and Mrs. Tucker, and
the Bennetts were delighted with Pete's Patch
and went quite wild over the scenery; but it
was clear to everybody that Henrietta's decidedly
aristocratic little grandmother and
Marjory's overwhelmingly neat Aunty Jane
had never been intended by nature for camp
life. Mrs. Slater, to be sure, enjoyed the fine
sky, the wonderful expanse of blue water, the
beautiful golden-brown river, and the deep,
cool forest. She liked all these in a quiet,
understanding way; but one could see, although
the tactful gentlewoman was most polite about
it all, that the lowly balsam beds, the rough
benches, the careless attire of the castaways had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
proved rather shocking to a lady accustomed
always to luxurious ways of living. As for
Aunty Jane, she liked nothing and did not
hesitate to denounce camp life and all pertaining
to it, Terrible Tim included.</p>

<p>"Marjory!" she had exclaimed, at first
sight of her usually spotless niece, "your dress
is a perfect sight! Go this instant and put on
a clean one."</p>

<p>"Why!" returned surprised Marjory, "this
is my clean one&mdash;I washed it yesterday."</p>

<p>"<i>Washed</i> it!" gasped Aunty Jane. "Well,
you couldn't have used much water."</p>

<p>"Only the whole lake," returned Marjory,
meekly. "But we haven't any flatirons, so we
just pull things somewhere near the right shape
and dry them on the bushes. It's lovely fun
to wash&mdash;we go right in with our clothes."</p>

<p>"Do you <i>cook</i> in those filthy pans?" next
demanded Aunty Jane, inspecting the fruit of
the large pine that served, as Mr. Black punned
merrily, as a "pan-tree."</p>

<p>"They're clean <i>inside</i>," defended Jean.
"That's smoke from the camp fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wash the <i>outside</i> of my saucepans,"
sniffed Aunty Jane, with blighting emphasis.
"Also my frying-pans."</p>

<p>"It isn't considered proper in camp," returned
Mr. Black, whose eyes were twinkling
wickedly; "but if you'd like a little missionary
work, Miss Jane, there's the dishcloth."</p>

<p>"Dishcloth!" gasped Aunty Jane, disdainfully,
eying the fairly clean rag drying in the
sun. "I wouldn't scrub my coal bin with a
cloth the color of that."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't scrub mine with <i>anything</i>,"
laughed Mrs. Bennett; "but never mind, Aunty
Jane, our girls seem to be thriving in spite of
torn dresses and unscoured pans. This life is
doing them a world of good."</p>

<p>"Good!" sniffed Aunty Jane. "Why!
The place must be fairly swarming with
germs. I shouldn't <i>think</i> of permitting Marjory
to remain here&mdash;I shall take her home
with me to-night."</p>

<p>This was lightning from a clear sky. For a
moment nobody said a word. Then there was
a chorus of protests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no!" shrieked Bettie, hurling herself
upon Aunty Jane. "She can't go."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>please</i>, Aunty Jane," cried Jean.
"We can't spare her&mdash;she's our telescope and
our ears."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>," stormed Mabel, "we <i>must</i> keep
her. <i>She</i> likes it here&mdash;and look at her face&mdash;all
brown&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With dirt," snapped Auntie Jane. "It'll
take me a month to get that child clean&mdash;and
a year to scour off those disgusting freckles."</p>

<p>Marjory groaned. The prospect was certainly
dismal.</p>

<p>"Never mind," counseled impish Henrietta,
whispering in Marjory's ear. "You can run
away&mdash;I'll help you. You can easily hide in
the bushes so she can't find you when the time
comes&mdash;there's forty good places to hide in&mdash;let's
find one now."</p>

<p>"No," moaned Marjory, "I <i>can't</i> do that&mdash;I
wouldn't dare to. And it won't do a mite
of good to tease. If she says a thing she sticks
to it&mdash;it's all over for poor me."</p>

<p>When things went wrong, Bettie cried easily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Henrietta wept copiously, and Mabel wailed
uproariously; but Marjory, restrained little
soul that she was, was seldom known to shed
tears. But now several large specimens began
to roll down Marjory's cheeks, and presently,
to Mr. Black's dismay, the little girl was sobbing
bitterly, with her head against Jean's flat
but motherly bosom.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Black and Mrs. Crane pleaded
with Aunty Jane. All the parents reasoned
with her. Even Mrs. Slater, who was no
camper herself, implored Miss Higgins to
change her mind. But that was a thing that
the poor lady never <i>could</i> do. Some people
<i>can't</i> change their minds&mdash;Aunty Jane couldn't.
Even when she wanted to she couldn't.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'll be more amiable after dinner,"
suggested gentle Doctor Tucker, whose
mild eyes were shining at the prospect of catching
a trout with the hook that Mr. Black was
baiting for him. "Many persons are."</p>

<p>But the splendid noon dinner that hungry
Aunty Jane had expected to devour was still
nearly a mile from shore in Captain Berry's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
launch, and the other launch-man couldn't go
after it; because, having incautiously ventured
too near shore, he was now engaged in half-hearted
attempts to dislodge his stranded craft
from a troublesome sand bar. He declined all
offers of assistance, saying that Captain Berry,
whose engine would surely work <i>sometime</i>,
could easily tow him into deeper water&mdash;<i>he</i>
wasn't goin' to work hisself to death for nobody,
no, not he.</p>

<p>As nobody wanted to row a mile or more
and then back again with a load of heavy
baskets, nobody did; so Mrs. Crane did the
best she could with what she had; but the
camp-cooked dinner did not appeal to Aunty
Jane, who refused to eat venison that Dave
had touched and had no appetite for plain
beans, boiled potatoes, and cindery johnny-cake.
Altogether, poor Aunty Jane, who was
never <i>very</i> pleasant, was in her unhappiest
mood.</p>

<p>"You see," apologized Mrs. Crane, "our
provisions are pretty low; we haven't a very
large supply of cups and plates, and of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
you haven't been here long enough to acquire
an appetite for camp fare. Let me give you
a piece of this trout, Miss Higgins."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," was Aunty Jane's frigid
reply. "I never eat fish."</p>

<p>"These beans," assured Mrs. Slater, politely,
"are very nice indeed."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure," said Doctor Bennett, "this
is excellent coffee, even if I <i>do</i> have to drink
from a cocoa can."</p>

<p>But Aunty Jane scorned them both.</p>

<p>"Tell us," urged Mr. Black, "about that
boy of ours. What do you think of him?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied the merry doctor, "the lad's
all right, considering what he's been through.
But, judging from his extreme thinness, being
shipwrecked is only a small part of his unhappy
experience."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?" demanded Mrs.
Mapes, uneasily.</p>

<p>"No, my dear woman&mdash;<i>all</i> my dear women,"
Doctor Bennett hastened to add, "he
hasn't had smallpox. But I <i>do</i> know that he
was a sick boy <i>before</i> he was shipwrecked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
because his body shows that he has lost more
flesh than a boy <i>could</i> lose in so short a time."</p>

<p>"Yes," corroborated Mrs. Crane, "he was
<i>very</i> thin when we found him."</p>

<p>"Tuberculosis!" breathed Aunty Jane.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," declared the doctor.</p>

<p>"But he was dreadfully thin," asserted Mabel.
"His legs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind his legs," said Doctor Bennett.
"It's his head that troubles us now. His
body is mending with every moment; but
there's something seriously wrong with his
memory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dangerous lunatic!" gasped excitable
Aunty Jane, half rising from her seat.</p>

<p>"No, no!" shouted the exasperated doctor,
who didn't like Aunty Jane. "Nothing of the
sort. Merely a very pitiable boy who has been
extremely ill, probably with pneumonia. A boy
who is naturally very bright, in all ways but
the one. A boy with an excellent constitution
or this last experience would have finished him.
The best thing we can possibly do for him is
to keep him right here, build up his strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in this splendid air, and then, when he's entirely
well, take him to a specialist&mdash;I'm wiser
about bodies than brains."</p>

<p>"Could I make him a pudding?" demanded
Mabel, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"No," roared the doctor. "We want him
to get <i>well</i>."</p>

<p>"As for me," said Henrietta, "I shan't be
able to sleep nights until I know that boy's real
name."</p>

<p>"Take my word for it," warned Aunty
Jane, "he isn't worth saving. He'll prove
either a thief or a tramp; or perhaps both. I
wouldn't <i>think</i> of taking in a stranger like
that."</p>

<p>Mabel was about to retort indignantly, and,
it is to be feared, impolitely; for this candid
child was sometimes too candid; when Henrietta
whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be terrible if he proved to be
just like Aunty Jane!"</p>

<p>This thought was so appalling, in spite of
its impossibility, that for ten seconds Mabel
sat in silence, with her eyes fairly bulging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Henrietta," she breathed finally, "weren't&mdash;weren't
you just fooling?"</p>

<p>"Listen!" warned Henrietta.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be deceived fifty times," Mrs.
Crane was saying, "than let even a tramp go
hungry; but that's an honest lad or I never
saw one. It's quite possible that he's poor,
but that's no crime."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>Dave Makes Himself Useful</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>SHOUTS from the lake now claimed the
campers' attention. Captain Berry's obstinate
engine had suddenly decided to work
and was now making up for lost time by refusing
to stop. The captain, as near shore
as he dared approach, was spinning round and
round in circles. Each time he neared the
land he shouted lustily.</p>

<p>"He wants something," interpreted Mr.
Black, rising from the table. "Marjory&mdash;where
is Marjory with her sharp ears?"</p>

<p>"Crying in our tent," replied Mabel, with
a vindictive glance toward Aunty Jane. "If
she wasn't a <i>good</i> child, she'd climb a tree and
stay there until some folks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there," squelched Doctor Bennett,
"we mustn't criticise our elders. Let's see
what that crazy boat is doing."</p>

<p>"She's stopped," said Mr. Black, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Dave's swimming ashore&mdash;after the boats, I
guess. Let's help him."</p>

<p>Presently all sorts of boxes, bundles, and
baskets were safely landed; all the campers
and most of the visitors helping the good work
along. Even Marjory, her face swollen and
disfigured from much weeping, assisted a
little.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" cried Dave, catching sight of the
sorrowful countenance. "W'at you ees cry
for, li'le gal?"</p>

<p>Tactful Jean, seeing that Marjory was unable
to speak, replied for her.</p>

<p>"Her aunt&mdash;she hasn't any mother, you
know&mdash;is going to take her home. She
doesn't want to go; but she can't help herself."</p>

<p>"Dat's too bad," sympathized Dave.
"W'ich of dose ees hees aunt?"</p>

<p>Jean pointed out Aunty Jane&mdash;a middle-aged,
unattractive lady, who sat bolt upright
when everybody else loafed in comfortable,
camp-y attitudes.</p>

<p>"Yas, Ah'm see dose old gal biffore," admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
disrespectful Dave, eying Aunty Jane's
stiff, unconscious back reflectively. "Ah'm
not lak' dose kind of lady ver' moch&mdash;she ees
tole me for take som' <i>bat'</i>."</p>

<p>Even Marjory smiled forlornly at the idea
of Dave's taking a bath. But smiles did not
last long that day. In spite of all the good
things that came in baskets and bundles, in
spite of a big box of candy that Saunders
had included for Mabel and Henrietta, and inscribed
"With the Game Warden's Compliments,"
the sympathetic little girls were very
unhappy at the thought of losing Marjory.
They had <i>always</i> played together; and now
they were absolutely certain that they <i>couldn't</i>
have good times during the rest of their stay
with no Marjory to help enjoy them. As for
Marjory, that small maiden was shedding so
many tears that Mabel feared there would soon
be nothing left of her unhappy little friend.
And by afternoon even the grown-ups were
thoroughly vexed by Aunty Jane's obstinacy.</p>

<p>"Oh, we all know," said Mrs. Bennett to
Mrs. Tucker, who sat under a tree, letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
down a skirt for Bettie, "that Aunty Jane
<i>means</i> well; she'd work her fingers to the bone
for Marjory; but a <i>real</i> mother wouldn't be
a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vinegar cruet," supplied Doctor Bennett.</p>

<p>"She has completely spoiled the day," declared
Mrs. Tucker, "for all those children;
and we <i>meant</i> to give them a pleasant surprise."</p>

<p>"Poor Aunty Jane <i>couldn't</i> be a pleasant
surprise," protested Mrs. Bennett, "but we
mustn't blame her&mdash;<i>she</i> didn't pick out her unfortunate
disposition. We'll just have to be
extra cheerful ourselves this afternoon to make
up for her unpleasantness."</p>

<p>But no one succeeded in being "extra
cheerful," when there was so much gloom to
dispel; to the children, especially, the day
seemed absolutely spoiled in spite of much unexpected
and rather amusing sympathy from
Dave, who plainly considered going home with
Aunty Jane an unmixed calamity.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Jean, shrewdly, "that Dave
<i>likes</i> to have us here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why not?" demanded Henrietta.
"We give him all sorts of good things to eat
and Mr. Black pays him besides, for all the
work he doesn't do. He's just bought himself
a nice new blanket and a fine big quilt&mdash;I noticed
them on the beach. Why! Something's
happening. Let's see what it is."</p>

<p>Dave, with a large bundle on his shoulder,
was crossing the clearing, in the direction of
his wigwam. Aunty Jane, pointing at the bundle
and scolding loudly, was scurrying after
him. Mrs. Bennett and Mrs. Mapes were scurrying
after <i>her</i>. Mrs. Slater, under a tree with
Mrs. Tucker, seemed greatly amused; for this
bright old lady possessed a strong sense of
humor.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> it, Granny?" demanded Henrietta,
pausing at sight of the dainty little grandmother's
smiling countenance. "Is she trying
again to make Dave take a bath?"</p>

<p>"No, Honey," laughed Mrs. Slater. "She
thinks she recognizes that quilt&mdash;she missed
one off her clothesline several nights ago."</p>

<p>Dave, seeing that Aunty Jane was not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
be shaken off, stopped, untied his bundle, separated
the quilt from the other articles, and
offered it to the pursuing lady.</p>

<p>"Yas," grinned Dave, "Ah'm t'ink dose
queelt she ees yours, maybe. She's grow on
som' clothesline jus' biffore de back part of
dose house of madame hon Lakeveele. Me,
Ah'm need som' more queelt&mdash;som' tam' Ah'm
got company. Mus' feex noddaire bed, Ah'm
t'ink."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Aunty Jane, tartly, as she
reached for the guilt, "you'd better think
again. Give it to me this instant."</p>

<p>Then, catching a whiff of the aroma that
was ever a part of Dave, Aunty Jane fairly
hurled the restored comforter at the grinning
thief.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake!" she gasped. "<i>Take</i>
it, you filthy Indian. There isn't water enough
in Lake Superior to get the smell out of anything
you've touched."</p>

<p>"Yas," returned Dave, blandly accepting the
quilt, "Ah'm sleep hon dose queelt hall de way
from Lakeveele. Night biffore, halso. Ah'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
moch obliged for dose present, madame.
Dose ver' good queelt, Ah'm t'ink."</p>

<p>"A great deal too good for you, you filthy
beast."</p>

<p>Dave's ill-kept teeth still gleamed in his wide,
amiable smile; but his narrowed black eyes suddenly
glittered in a cold, snaky way that
started an unpleasant chill down Aunty Jane's
spine.</p>

<p>"That wicked Indian," she said afterwards,
"thanked me and looked as if he'd like to murder
me, all in the same breath."</p>

<p>"Indians," mused Doctor Tucker, "are said
to be revengeful."</p>

<p>Perhaps, with so many little girls sorrowful
on Marjory's account, the sky hadn't the
heart to keep on smiling. At any rate, a full
hour earlier than the visitors had expected to
leave, their launch-man was pointing pessimistically
toward gathering clouds&mdash;no one
else had noticed them.</p>

<p>"If you folks want to get home before it
rains," said he, "you'd better be climbing
aboard&mdash;less'n you want to stay here all night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried Aunty Jane, springing to
her feet, "I wouldn't stay for a million dollars."</p>

<p>Mrs. Slater was too polite to <i>say</i> that she
wouldn't either; but she, too, rose rather hastily
to look about for scattered belongings.</p>

<p>Dave assisted everybody with wonderful
alacrity. He was here, there, and everywhere.
The girls assisted, too&mdash;perhaps that was why
it took so long to find all Marjory's widely
dispersed garments. They were still at this
task after most of the mothers had climbed
aboard the launch. Marjory, by this time
fairly helpless with grief, sat on a log and
wept; while Aunty Jane, on her knees under
a nearby tree, attempted to roll the accumulated
garments into a neat bundle.</p>

<p>Somehow&mdash;nobody knew exactly how&mdash;Terrible
Tim, the porcupine, made his presence
felt just at this busy moment. One instant
the object in Aunty Jane's grasp was an
innocent bundle of clothing. The next, the
horrified lady was clutching an astonished and
most dreadfully prickly porcupine; for Timothy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
propelled by some mysterious force, had
landed squarely in her arms.</p>

<p>Instantly the air was rent with shrieks. No
one noticed the extra shriek or two that Marjory
added to the chorus as a dark, sinewy arm
shot forth and suddenly grasped her. No one
saw lithe Dave draw the frightened, dazed little
girl into the thicket, toss her across his shoulder,
and flee, by a roundabout trail that no
civilized foot could have found, toward his own
wigwam.</p>

<p>"Be still," commanded Dave, clapping his
hand gently but effectually over Marjory's
mouth. "Don't be scare&mdash;Ah'm good frien'
to you, li'le gal. Now ron, ron fast hon your
own leg."</p>

<p>Astonishment prevented further desire to
shriek, for, near the doorway of Dave's wigwam
and washing a grimy pan with a grimier
rag, stood a dark but decidedly attractive
young woman. And down in the dirt at her
feet, as Marjory had seen her many times
previously, groveled the Dandelion Cottage
baby, the unforgettable Rosa Marie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjory, at sight of the funny little Indian
baby that Mabel had once adopted, almost forgot
her own troubles.</p>

<p>"Ma sistaire," explained Dave, pointing toward
the woman. "Hees name ees Mahjigeezigoqua.
Can you say dose name?"</p>

<p>"Mar-gee-gee-ze-go-qua," repeated Marjory,
correctly making the first g soft, the second
hard. "But how did you get them here?
We didn't see them leave the boat."</p>

<p>"Ah'm pack dem wit' dose proveesion,"
laughed Dave. "Ah'm poot dose two hon
shore behin' som' point, w'ile all dose peop' ees
too busy for look at Dave. Ma sistaire ees
come for pick som' berry. Hey, you know
dose kid? W'y you no talk, Rosa Marie?
Here ees som' frien' for you."</p>

<p>Then Dave spoke rapidly in some strange
tongue to his sister, concluding in his broken
English, as he turned to go:</p>

<p>"Now Ah'm go for help dose ol' Aunt hon
top dose boat. You stay here."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, conscientious Marjory started
to follow him; but Rosa Marie's mother, stepping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
quickly into the narrow pathway, gently
but unmistakably detained her.</p>

<p>"You talk som' leetle t'ing to Rosa Marie&mdash;she
ees remembaire you, ees eet not, Rosa?
See, how he ees grow som' hon herself, dose so
fat Rosa."</p>

<p>So Marjory, seeing no way of immediate
escape with the attractive young Indian woman
firmly blocking the pathway, renewed her acquaintance
with Rosa Marie, who apparently
was as stolid and as unemotional as ever.</p>

<p>"Hees fadaire lak' dat," explained Mahjigeezigoqua.
"He t'ink hon hees inside
honly. No talk, no mak' som' smile hon her
face, dose man."</p>

<p>If Rosa Marie <i>did</i> any thinking, it is certain
that the process went on "inside only," for if
ever there was a wooden little Indian it was
Rosa Marie. But by dint of hard work, Marjory
finally extracted a smile. Then Rosa
Marie, groping under her brief skirts, produced
the very dirtiest and most disreputable
doll that Marjory had ever beheld.</p>

<p>"Ma-<i>bel</i>," said Rosa Marie. "Ma-<i>bel</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"She ees name for Mees Ma<i>bel</i>," explained
the Indian baby's mother.</p>

<p>"Mabel ought to feel flattered," giggled
Marjory. "I'll tell her about her namesake.
But mercy! I must go back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," said Dave's sister, lightly clasping
her slender brown fingers about Marjory's
wrist. "Ah show you how to catch som'
chipmunk."</p>

<p>And Marjory, realizing that she was a prisoner,
stayed where she was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>A Twisted Conscience</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BY the time Dave returned, Aunty Jane had
been separated from Terrible Tim and a
large number of loose quills. All the others
had embarked, but Aunty Jane, breathing
dire threats, still lingered to look for Marjory.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," asked Henrietta, sincerely,
"that she didn't go aboard with that last
boat-load? I don't think she was here when
poor Timothy tumbled out of that tree."</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> he tumble?" snapped Aunty Jane. "<i>I</i>
think he jumped."</p>

<p>At this moment, Dave&mdash;the only person
who knew exactly how Terrible Tim happened
to land where he did&mdash;joined in the search for
Marjory.</p>

<p>"Ah'm smell pooty good," asserted crafty
Dave, crawling about on all-fours and making
an elaborate pretense of sniffing at the sand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
"and Ah'm sure dose gal ees mak' som' track
for dose boat."</p>

<p>"Hi there!" shouted Mr. Black, from the
beach. "Captain says he can't wait a moment
longer&mdash;other boat's halfway home by now.
Or are you going to stay with us, Miss Higgins?
There's plenty of room."</p>

<p>"No, I'm <i>not</i>," snapped Aunty Jane, fleeing
down the bank. "With your dirty Indians
and your flying beasts this is no place for a
decent woman."</p>

<p>It is said that one disagreeable person in
camp can spoil the very pleasantest party, and
the saying must be true, for with Aunty Jane
at Pete's Patch nothing had seemed quite right&mdash;the
luster was gone from everything&mdash;even
the sky. But, as Captain Berry's delayed
launch began the determined chug-chugging
that soon carried the little boat into deeper
water, everybody on shore breathed a sigh of
relief; and overhead, as Henrietta pointed out,
laughingly, a tiny patch of gold glimmered
among the clouds.</p>

<p>"They say," mused Mr. Black, "that living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
close to Nature brings out all your traits more
strongly."</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter," laughed Mrs. Crane, "I've
noticed that you're lazier here than you were
in town."</p>

<p>"I was thinking," returned Mr. Black, with
dignity, "that folks with sharp tongues and
twisted tempers ought never to venture into
the woods."</p>

<p>Aunty Jane was a good mile from shore before
Dave turned, with his wickedest grin, toward
the castaways.</p>

<p>"Come wit' me," he invited. "Ah'm fool
dose aunt lady, Ah'm t'ink."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mr.
Black.</p>

<p>"Come wit' me," repeated Dave, with the
most complacent of smiles. "Ah'm show you
som' deer in a trap&mdash;Ah'm snare heem just
now."</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Black and the girls wanted
to see so unusual a sight as a trapped deer;
but when they discovered that the deer was a
dear, their own beloved Marjory, their astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
was great. And of course they were
no less surprised to see Rosa Marie and Mahjigeezigoqua,
her almost unspellable mother.</p>

<p>"Marjory!" gasped Jean. "We thought
you were on the boat!"</p>

<p>"Marjory," panted Mabel. "All your
clothes <i>are</i> on that boat."</p>

<p>"These aren't," returned Marjory, indicating
what she had on. "And my skin isn't&mdash;I
can wear that, if I have to."</p>

<p>"Granny brought me loads of things," assured
Henrietta. "I guess you won't need to
come down to skin."</p>

<p>"Marjory," demanded Mr. Black, rather
severely for so mild a man, "do you mean to
say that you were naughty enough to deliberately
hide from Aunty Jane?"</p>

<p>Marjory colored, but remained silent. It
occurred to her suddenly that telling the truth
would seem a good deal like disloyalty to Dave&mdash;Dave,
who had been her friend. As Marjory
was not in the habit of fibbing, she didn't
know what to say.</p>

<p>"Eef dose gal won't ron away on herself,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
explained Dave, promptly exonerating Marjory
from all blame, "me, Ah'm mus' ron away wit'
heem. Ah'm pull heem into de bush and ron,
ron lak' de dev' (devil). Hey, li'le gal; Ah'm
good frien' to you, hey? An' now dose aunt,
w'at smell too strong wit' hees nose, ees gone
two-t'ree mile, Ah'm t'ink."</p>

<p>"Dave," queried Mr. Black, shaking his
head soberly, "is there any way of discovering
what you <i>do</i> think? Are you all rascal or are
you part angel&mdash;with the angel part very much
disguised? I can't make you out."</p>

<p>But this was too deep for Dave.</p>

<p>"Ah'm t'ink," replied Dave, replying to
only the first part of Mr. Black's question,
"dat dose poor li'le Margy ees don't want to
go home wit' hees aunt. Me, Ah'm not care
for go home wit' dose aunt maself."</p>

<p>At this the delighted girls shrieked with
mirth, for the idea of Aunty Jane taking Dave
home with her would have amused even
Dave's solemn dog. Mr. Black, however, still
frowned slightly, for Dave puzzled him.</p>

<p>"Dave," said he, "you're altogether too full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of tricks. I suppose you don't know what
courtesy toward a woman means; but you've
certainly been ruder than you should have been
to poor Miss Higgins. You'll have to go to
Lakeville to-night and tell that poor woman
that Marjory is safe&mdash;perhaps I'd better write
her a note so she won't blame Marjory."</p>

<p>"Ah'm go right off," agreed Dave, cheerfully.
"Maybe Ah'm find som' more queelt
on hees line."</p>

<p>"Dave, you incorrigible rascal," stormed
Mr. Black, "you let that lady's clothesline
alone. Steal one off <i>my</i> line, if you must have
a quilt&mdash;I'm better able to spare it."</p>

<p>"Ah'm good frien' to <i>you</i>," protested Dave,
earnestly, with the outstretched hand of good-fellowship.
"You shake hon dat?"</p>

<p>"I hope you are," returned Mr. Black, shaking
the proffered hand. "But, Dave, your conscience
is like that river&mdash;no one could possibly
map its windings. And after this, my
man, you must be a good friend to my <i>friends</i>,
as well as to me. Now let's go back to camp
and see what our Billy boy is doing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave, evidently somewhat troubled, for he
still had an unconfessed misdeed on his mind,
followed the castaways back to the clearing.
They found Mrs. Crane sitting disconsolately
on the bench outside her tent.</p>

<p>"That boy's so blue," she confided, advancing
to meet them, "that I'm staying outside
to give him a chance to cry. I guess he thought
the doctor was going to cure him right off and
he's terribly disappointed."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we tell him about Dave and
Aunty Jane?" queried Bettie. "That ought
to cheer anybody&mdash;just think, Mrs. Crane,
Dave hid Marjory in his wigwam, with Rosa
Marie and her mother."</p>

<p>"Rosa Marie! And didn't Marjory go on
the boat?"</p>

<p>"No, Marjory's back there with Mabel and
Rosa Marie&mdash;she's Dave's niece."</p>

<p>"Dave's niece! Well, well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess Dave doesn't like Aunty Jane," interrupted
Henrietta. "I can't be sure&mdash;it was
all so exciting just then&mdash;but I <i>think</i> Dave slid
down the trunk of one of those big trees just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
after Terrible Tim landed between Aunty Jane
and that bundle."</p>

<p>"She might have been badly hurt," said
Mrs. Crane, indignantly. "Dave, come here
a moment&mdash;I want to talk to you. Did you
drop that porcupine into Miss Higgins' lap?"</p>

<p>"Eef som' porkypine ees go for drop," returned
Dave, whimsically, "eet ees good dat
he ees land on som' sof' plass. Som' tam',
Ah'm tole, she's rain cat an' dog; som' tam'
she's rain porkypine. W'at for? Me, Ah'm
can't tole you. De sky she ees made dose
way."</p>

<p>"Well," warned Mrs. Crane, "you'd better
see to it, Dave, that it doesn't rain any more
porcupines&mdash;I don't like such tricks."</p>

<p>"Ah'm not please nobody," sighed Dave,
dolefully, "w'en Ah'm try all day to help all
dose body."</p>

<p>"But, Dave," remonstrated Mrs. Crane,
"you do so many wrong things. You stole
that quilt from Miss Higgins' line, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yas," replied Dave. "Dose blanket, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dave, you poor benighted creature! Don't
you know it's wrong to steal?"</p>

<p>"Yas," admitted incorrigible Dave, with an
unmistakable twinkle in his eye. "Ah'm
t'ink so, w'en som'body ees eat up all dose
venison of me. She's very bad for stole all
dose meat&mdash;Me, Ah'm have no dinnaire, me.
Halso, Ah'm got no suppaire, Ah'm <i>sop</i>pose.
Mus' break som' more game law&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dave!" cried Mrs. Crane, contritely.
"You sit right down at that table and I'll give
you the best meal you ever ate."</p>

<p>"But," mourned the wily half-breed, seating
himself, nevertheless, "Rosa Marie, ma sistaire,
too, mus' dose two starve?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, no!" gasped Mrs. Crane.
"I'll fix something for them, too."</p>

<p>"Som' day," promised Dave, sincerely,
"Ah'm geeve you som' good fat moskrat."</p>

<p>Too polite to say so, Mrs. Crane hoped fervently
that Dave would forget that promise;
she was quite certain that she wouldn't enjoy
eating a "good fat muskrat," or even a very
thin one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>Billy's Memory</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>WHILE Mrs. Crane was supplying Dave
with a bountiful meal, the girls were
telling Billy about Rosa Marie, Marjory, Aunty
Jane, the porcupine&mdash;in short, all the news of
that eventful day. Billy, with brightening
eyes, was certainly enjoying it all, particularly
the part about Terrible Tim.</p>

<p>"Once," began Billy, reminiscently, "when
I was a kid I saw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what Billy had seen could only be
guessed, for the brightness slipped from his
eyes and he pulled the corner of his blanket
over his face.</p>

<p>"I can't remember a blamed thing," he
mumbled, with a catch in his throat.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," teased Henrietta, gently.
"Nobody 'd <i>want</i> to remember anything that
looks like Terrible Tim. But when you see
him, you'll probably remember what you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
going to say. Did they tell you that you're to
come outside to-morrow and lie in a hammock
with soft-boiled eggs? Oh, I mean you're to
<i>eat</i> the eggs. Aren't you glad?"</p>

<p>"I like eggs," said the boy, uncovering one
eye. "Chicken, too, and roast beef."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Dave will get you a partridge&mdash;Doctor
Bennett said you could eat that. Did
you ever eat partridge?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Billy.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Bettie and Henrietta,
with one voice.</p>

<p>"At&mdash;at&mdash;oh, it's gone!" wailed Billy,
"when I had it right at the end of my tongue."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," soothed motherly Jean.
"You're a <i>lot</i> better than you were yesterday.
We can all see that."</p>

<p>"Think so? Well, maybe I am. Is that&mdash;yes,
it <i>is</i> milk toast. Tastes just like food.
<i>Sure</i> I'm ready for another bite."</p>

<p>"It's the good sweet cream those people
brought," said Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p>"I hope," murmured Billy, between bites,
"they'll come often."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't," protested Mabel. "Visitors are
a nuisance&mdash;they stir things up too much."</p>

<p>"Her mother scrubbed her," laughed Henrietta,
"and brushed a lot of sand out of her
hair&mdash;didn't you hear terrible wails? But Mabel
was glad to see her mother, just the same."</p>

<p>The threatening clouds that had so alarmed
the two launch-men passed harmlessly over
Pete's Patch; and the next day proved so fine
that Billy was moved to a hammock under the
trees, where the overlapping leaves of huge
maples formed a most attractive roof. The
change agreed with him; fortified with fresh
eggs and fresh air he grew stronger with astonishing
rapidity; a rapidity that proved
alarming to Mrs. Crane; for, like Bettie, this
new invalid was no sooner on his feet than
he made tracks for the alluring lake.</p>

<p>"If I had a bathing suit," said Billy, when
Mrs. Crane had, for the fourth time, forbidden
him to wade in the lake, "I'd go in <i>swimming</i>&mdash;then
you couldn't pull me out so easily."</p>

<p>"But, Billy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be good," promised Billy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
"but that's a mighty fine bunch of water&mdash;say,
couldn't you <i>make</i> some swimming tights
for a chap?"</p>

<p>"When you're strong enough to swim,"
agreed Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p>Physically, young Billy improved by leaps
and bounds; but the stronger he grew, the more
he worried over his strange lapses of memory.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I dream things," complained
Billy, one day. "And when I wake up I wonder
how much of it is true. Last night I
thought I was falling down, down out of an
airship and I called 'Mother, mother! I can't
find my umbrella.'"</p>

<p>"Have you a mother?" asked Jean, quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I think so&mdash;I dream of
some person who says: 'Now don't do that,
Lad&mdash;Lad&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Laddie," supplied Bettie, promptly.</p>

<p>"Laddie!" shouted the boy. "That's it&mdash;it
didn't get away <i>that</i> time."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Laddie-Billy, another
day, "when Dave comes into sight, I <i>almost</i>
call him by another name; but the name doesn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
quite come&mdash;I think I've known somebody&mdash;in
a boat, perhaps&mdash;that looked like him."</p>

<p>There were many things, fortunately, that
the boy had not forgotten. He handled his
knife and fork properly, ate his soup daintily,
and proved later that he had once been able
to row a boat; though at first, of course, his
strength had been unequal to very strenuous
efforts with the oars. In spite of his unhappy
experience with the lake, he seemed, strangely
enough, to be exceedingly fond of the water
and to feel not the slightest fear of it. Mrs.
Crane, indeed, would have been glad to find
him more cowardly; for, long before the purposely
delayed bathing suit was ready, Billy
had gone in swimming in his only clothes.
Also, it was next to impossible to keep him
out of the boats.</p>

<p>Time proved, too, that the water-loving
castaway was a bright lad. He could read
and write very readily in English, knew a little
French, and was rather clever at figures.
Often, when glancing through the advertising
pages of magazines, his expressive face would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
light up and Laddie-Billy (as the girls now
called him to please Mabel) would exclaim,
joyfully: "I've seen <i>that</i> picture before."</p>

<p>But the things that the curiously afflicted
boy <i>wanted</i> to remember refused obstinately
to come; and this grieved him sorely.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Billy, one balmy evening,
when all the youngsters were roasting potatoes
between two glowing logs, "I'm really well
enough to go home, but&mdash;but where <i>is</i> my
home?"</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about that," assured
Mrs. Crane. "We're more than willing to
keep you right here&mdash;as long as you don't
tumble out of those boats."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Mr. Black, heartily, "we
really need a boy to help us when Dave is busy
breaking the game laws. I'm only afraid that
Saunders will come along some day with an
answer to that advertisement. You're well
worth keeping, my lad."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," smiled Billy, cheered
by these kindly assurances. "I'll try to be,
anyway."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"We <i>all</i> like you," declared Mabel, "even
if you <i>are</i> getting fat."</p>

<p>"Am I?" queried Laddie-Billy, anxiously.
"Gracious! If I do, these clothes&mdash;can it be
that I'll come to wearing a blue plaid bathing
suit <i>all</i> the time?"</p>

<p>For Mrs. Crane, for want of other material,
was slowly converting her biggest and most
gorgeous gingham apron into a decidedly
queer bathing costume for her lively charge.</p>

<p>"The bagginess," Mrs. Crane explained,
when the castaway suggested mildly that part
of the cloth might be saved for other purposes,
"will fill up with air and keep you
from sinking."</p>

<p>And naughty Henrietta had added, under
her breath: "Behold Billy Blue-eyes, the Human
Balloon."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>A Mutual Friend</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>DURING the blissful summer that Jean,
Bettie, Mabel, and Marjory had spent in
Dandelion Cottage, and before the coming of
Henrietta, the little girls had frequently found
themselves in need of real money for their
make-believe housekeeping. In order to procure
the needed funds, they had rented a room
to a charming young woman named Miss
Blossom.</p>

<p>Miss Blossom's father, an organ tuner by
profession, visited many towns in the course
of a year. In July, while the castaways were
still in camp, some portion of the Presbyterian
organ in Lakeville went wrong; and skilful
Mr. Blossom, summoned to that town to repair
it, was accompanied by his very pleasant
daughter. Of course the very first thing she
did was to ask for her young friends.</p>

<p>"We've only three days to spend here," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
she, "but I <i>should</i> like to see those darling
girls&mdash;I've thought of them so many, many
times."</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Mrs. Bennett, to whom
Miss Blossom had appealed, "you go to Mr.
Saunders&mdash;he may be sending things up."</p>

<p>"Mr. William Saunders?" queried the
young woman, with interest. "Oh&mdash;I met
him when I was here last summer. Thank
you&mdash;I'll get father to take me to his office this
noon."</p>

<p>So that is how it happened that the ever-useful
Saunders, who had been commissioned
to supply Laddie-Billy with a wardrobe,
loaded Miss Blossom aboard Captain Berry's
launch that very afternoon. And then, feeling
certain that the pleasant and very pretty young
woman would be lonely with no one but the
captain for company, Mr. Saunders added
himself to the load.</p>

<p>The castaways, always eager for the arrival
of parcels from home, were all on the beach
to welcome the unexpected visitors. Even
Billy, who declared that he had never felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
better in his life, was part of the sunburnt
group.</p>

<p>"I know," lamented Billy, "that those
clothes'll be too small&mdash;I've grown a foot since
Mr. Black measured me three days ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, not a whole foot," protested Mrs.
Crane, eying her patient with pride. "But
I do think you're a credit to my nursing."</p>

<p>"It isn't everybody," beamed Billy, "that
has such a fine nurse&mdash;shall I help with that
boat, Mr. Black?"</p>

<p>"No, Dave'll take her out."</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Marjory, "there are <i>people</i>
getting into Captain Berry's skiff."</p>

<p>"I think," said Jean, a moment later, "that
the man is Mr. Saunders; but I don't know the
lady&mdash;I can't see her face."</p>

<p>"She looks young," said Marjory, with a
sigh of relief. "Too young to be Aunty Jane.
Just at first&mdash;Ugh! I was scared&mdash;Oh!
It's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Billy, springing suddenly to
his feet and rushing straight toward the landing
place, "it's Miss Blossom!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Blossom!" gasped Jean, gazing in
open-eyed amazement at the others.</p>

<p>"Miss Blossom!" echoed Mabel.</p>

<p>"Miss Blossom!" breathed Bettie. "Oh!
Look at Billy! It really <i>is</i> Miss Blossom, and
he knows her!"</p>

<p>It certainly looked as if Billy, the unknown
castaway, had found a friend; for, not waiting
for the boat to land, he had rushed into
the water (it was shallow, you remember, for
a long distance) and had seized the surprised
young woman in a bearlike hug.</p>

<p>"Miss Blossom! Miss Blossom!" he cried,
hopefully. "What <i>is</i> my name?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Laddie," returned the overwhelmed
(and almost overturned) young
woman, "what does all this mean? Never
before was I so warmly greeted by any young
man. Is this&mdash;Oh, I <i>see</i>. You're the sick and
shipwrecked boy that Mr. Saunders&mdash;but
<i>you're</i> not sick!"</p>

<p>"Not any more," gasped excited Billy, still
with an arm about Miss Blossom, as if fearful
she might escape. "But I can't remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
anything. Tell me, quick&mdash;where did I come
from?&mdash;who am I? I know <i>you</i>. I pumped
the organ for you&mdash;a big church&mdash;you played&mdash;Oh,
tell me, <i>tell</i> me."</p>

<p>"Wait," pleaded Miss Blossom, "until
we're on shore&mdash;you'll surely tip us over."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Billy, reluctantly. But
so great was his eagerness to get his friend
ashore that he got behind the boat and pushed.</p>

<p>"Now," demanded excited Billy, the moment
Miss Blossom was out of the boat,
"what's the rest of my name? Laddie&mdash;Laddie
<i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed Miss Blossom,
coloring with chagrin. "Honestly I don't,
Laddie. You see, so many boys have pumped
organs for us that I don't always remember
even their <i>first</i> names."</p>

<p>"But," panted Billy, with a catch in his
throat, "surely you'll remember the name of
the town?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o," faltered Miss Blossom, "I'm
afraid I don't. I remember your face and
your very bright hair&mdash;I can <i>see</i> that bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
head bobbing up and down in the light of a
stained glass window&mdash;but I <i>don't</i> know which
town or even which state I saw you in. But
don't worry, Laddie-boy. My father has a
list of all the organs he has ever mended.
Now, it must be some time within the last two
years that you pumped for us; and it is probable
that we stayed with that particular organ
for a number of days, else I wouldn't have
had time to learn that you were 'Laddie'&mdash;I
usually call the organ-pumper 'Boy.' Now,
when I've looked at father's list, I'll pick out
all the <i>long</i> jobs, discover what towns they
were in, and perhaps Mr. Saunders, here, will
write a notice to insert in the papers that are
published in those towns. Don't worry. One
of them will certainly be your town. And
here are all my precious girls patiently waiting
to be hugged!"</p>

<p>Miss Blossom proved a most delightful
visitor. The girls wanted to keep her, Mrs.
Crane urged her to stay; but Miss Blossom
declared that she owed it to Laddie-Billy to
get back to Lakeville as speedily as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Captain Berry, also, would remain for only
two hours; but everybody visited fast and furiously
for that precious interval of time&mdash;it
went all too quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure," declared Miss Blossom,
at parting, "that father's list will help."</p>

<p>"Let me know," pleaded Billy, who had
donned his becoming new clothes without delay
and happily found them sufficiently large, "if
you find anything."</p>

<p>"I surely will," promised Miss Blossom.</p>

<p>Three days later, Mr. Saunders, this time
on horseback, rode into camp.</p>

<p>"I'm commissioned," he explained, "to say
a certain word in Billy's hearing. Where is
he?"</p>

<p>"Getting washed for dinner," replied Henrietta,
flourishing the bread-knife toward the
river.</p>

<p>"Don't mention my errand," said Saunders.
"I'll spring it on Billy when we're all at table&mdash;I've
invited myself to dinner."</p>

<p>"We'll let everybody get seated before we
call Billy," agreed Henrietta. "And I'll warn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the girls. You might tie your horse behind
those bushes and perhaps he won't know
you're here until you speak."</p>

<p>Sure enough, hungry Billy plunged to his
place without observing the visitor; but when
the plates were filled, Mr. Saunders suddenly
leaned forward, looked at Billy, and remarked
casually: "The last time I was in Pittsburg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pittsburg!" gasped Billy, with widening
eyes. "Were you ever in Pittsburg?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Saunders, rather sheepishly.
"Were you?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" yelled Billy, joyously waving his
slice of bread. "Two-twenty-four Jefferson
Street, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; population
three hundred and twenty-one thousand.
<i>Sure!</i> I was <i>born</i> there! That's where I
<i>live</i>."</p>

<p>"But how," queried Henrietta, strong in all
matters geographical, "could a person set sail
from Pittsburg and be wrecked at Pete's
Patch, Upper Michigan?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't," replied Mr. Black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Saunders, "I've sent
notices to all the Pittsburg papers&mdash;what's that
street number again?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," stammered Billy. "It's
gone again. I guess it's easier to think when
you're not trying to."</p>

<p>"Jefferson Street," supplied Marjory, who
had remembered.</p>

<p>Billy nodded. "Yes," said he, "that sounds
right. But how did you guess Pittsburg, Mr.
Saunders?"</p>

<p>"In Mr. Blossom's note-book there was an
item, under the heading 'Pittsburg,' that read:
'Paid Laddie one dollar.'"</p>

<p>"Wonder where it went?" said the boy,
turning his empty pockets inside out.</p>

<p>"By this time to-morrow," promised
Saunders, "all Pittsburg will know that a
Pittsburg boy name Laddie, wrecked on Lake
Superior, is alive and well in&mdash;or near&mdash;Lakeville."</p>

<p>"Lost:" murmured Laddie, "a brindle pup;
answers to the name of Billy. Well, I'm awfully
obliged, Mr. Saunders; and my folks&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
wonder if my folks <i>want</i> to find me? Do you
s'pose they do?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," declared Mrs. Crane.
"But if they don't, <i>I'll</i> keep you."</p>

<p>"Nobody'd ever think," sniffed Mabel,
overcome with emotion, "that <i>I'd</i> found that
boy&mdash;everybody adopting him all the time."</p>

<p>"You found Rosa Marie, too, didn't you?"
teased Billy. "Well, I refuse to be a twin
sister to Rosa Marie."</p>

<p>"Who," asked Saunders, "is Rosa Marie?"</p>

<p>"She's a relative," remarked Mr. Black,
dryly, "that Dave imported for the express
purpose of eating our berries. Dave, it seems,
not only lives here himself but entertains his
relatives at our expense."</p>

<p>"And Peter encourages Dave in all his
iniquity," added Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p>"And," laughed Bettie, "Mrs. Crane cooks
for Dave and all his visitors."</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Mrs. Crane, "they'd
either starve or steal if I didn't."</p>

<p>"Dave," said Marjory, who had learned
much of the Gurneau family history from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
friendly Indian, "has nine brothers and seven
sisters&mdash;his mother had seventeen children."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Mr. Black,
"do they <i>all</i> live here at times?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Marjory. "Most of them
are in Canada."</p>

<p>"Dear me," breathed Mrs. Crane, fervently,
"I hope they'll stay there."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>A Captured Fisherman</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>NOW that there was hope of learning more
about Billy Blue-eyes, the young campers
found it hard to wait patiently for possible
tidings from Pittsburg. They were all restless
and excited; Laddie in particular could
settle down to nothing.</p>

<p>"We'll all go fishing," declared Mr. Black.
"That'll keep Billy's mind off his troubles.
Dave says he knows a trail that will lead us
to the finest fishing spot in the country; so
we'll take a lunch and stay all day."</p>

<p>"Laddie," queried Mrs. Crane, anxiously,
"are you strong enough for such a long trip?"</p>

<p>"Sure," asserted her fidgety patient, "I
could pull in a <i>whale</i>."</p>

<p>"Then," declared Mrs. Crane, "I'll get
Mahjigeezigoqua to wash the dishes and
make the beds, and I'll go, too. I don't care
if I do get rheumatism&mdash;I haven't been fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
for <i>years</i>. And that young woman loves to do
things for us."</p>

<p>"No wonder," said Jean, "after all you did
for Rosa Marie last winter."</p>

<p>"Put on your very oldest shoes," ordered
Mr. Black. "You're to wade the river&mdash;Dave
says it's shallow all the way down, except in
a few spots where we can follow a trail along
the bank. He's cutting poles for everybody."</p>

<p>For perhaps half an hour, sure-footed Dave,
carrying the lunch in a bag on his back, led
the fishing party through thickets that Mr.
Black had supposed impenetrable, to come out
at last on the river bank. It was their own
many-curved river, but so wildly beautiful at
this seldom visited spot that even quiet Mrs.
Crane exclaimed loudly. Then, their hooks
baited, they waded into the shallow, winding
stream, and fished.</p>

<p>"Go <i>down</i> dose stream," commanded Dave.
"Bam-bye she's take you back to Pete's
Patch."</p>

<p>"Here, Bettie," said Mr. Black, "I'll show
you how to cast your hook&mdash;Phew! Here's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
fish for you already&mdash;must have been ready
for breakfast!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, a wriggling, silvery trout dangled
from Mr. Black's pole.</p>

<p>"There's something running away with my
line," complained inexperienced Jean, a little
frightened by this uncanny sensation. "It
feels as big as a rabbit!"</p>

<p>"Pull it in," commanded Mr. Black,
"you've got a bite."</p>

<p>So she had, but the fish that had felt "as
big as a rabbit" proved so tiny that Mr. Black
put him back to grow; and the apparently unconcerned
little trout made a dart for Marjory's
hook. He seemed so determined to be
caught by <i>somebody</i>&mdash;it didn't matter who&mdash;that
Dave dug a little pool in the sand for him.</p>

<p>"Stay dere," ordered Dave, "till dose beeg
brodder of you ees have som' chance for got
caught."</p>

<p>"I don't think I want to fish," said tender-hearted
Jean. "I'd rather <i>look</i>. Every time
I take a step I see a new picture&mdash;I'd like to
keep all my eyes for the scenery."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"So would I," declared Bettie, pulling in
her line. "Let's just dawdle along together
somewhere out of reach of Mabel's hook&mdash;Goodness!
Look at Henrietta putting on her
own bait!"</p>

<p>"I did it, too," bragged Marjory. "I
couldn't wait for Dave&mdash;it's <i>such</i> fun to see
a trout dart out from under the bank and
grab your worm and run away with it."</p>

<p>"You must give a little jerk," instructed Mr.
Black. "Just like that."</p>

<p>"Just like this," added Mabel. But Mabel's
fish proved to be a log, so amid much laughter,
Dave provided her with a fresh hook.</p>

<p>For several wonderful hours, the happy
castaways waded and fished. Never in all their
wanderings had they encountered anything as
beautiful as the overhanging trees, the fern-fringed
banks, the softly gurgling water. And
never had fish seemed more willing to bite.
Even Dave was surprised at their voracity.
In spite of Mrs. Crane's heavy floundering,
in spite of the number of times that Mabel
slipped from slimy stones to land "kersplash"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
on her sturdy back, in spite of the delighted
shrieks that came from Marjory and Henrietta
at every bite, the hungry fish flocked to
the feast of angleworms.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Seated on the dry end was a stout, placid man</span></div>
</div>

<p>"Dose worms she's taste lak' pie to dose
feesh," explained Dave.</p>

<p>"I'd like it better," grumbled Mabel, whose
hook was continually catching in the trees, "if
there wasn't so much underbrush overhead."</p>

<p>"That's certainly a queer place," laughed
Billy, stringing his eleventh trout on the
branch provided by Dave, "for <i>under</i>brush.
Here, I'll pull it out for you."</p>

<p>The wonderfully happy morning passed all
too quickly&mdash;there should be some way of prolonging
summer mornings in a trout stream.
They had eaten their wholesome lunch, and
Mr. Black, his fine dark eyes aglow with eagerness,
his thick, almost-white hair standing up
all over his head, had fished in a dozen perfectly
marvelous holes that Dave had pointed
out, when the castaways reached in their wanderings
a point crossed by a broken-down
bridge. One end was still in place; the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sagged until it was partly submerged. Seated
on the dry end of this flimsy structure, fish-pole
in hand, was a stout, placid man, whose
mild, serene blue eyes invited confidence.</p>

<p>Sociable Mr. Black, still aglow with the joy
of his unusual luck and glad of a chance to
display his splendid catch, proudly disclosed
the contents of his basket&mdash;also of the basket
that Dave carried.</p>

<p>Billy, too, and the girls flocked nearer to
display <i>their</i> respective catches. It was certainly
a fine showing. Mr. Black, however,
had the lion's share.</p>

<p>"How many did you say?" drawled the
comfortable stranger, seemingly only mildly interested
in the count. His apparent indifference,
indeed, proved quite galling to Mr. Black,
who had introduced himself and his party.</p>

<p>"Seventy-two for mine," beamed Mr.
Black. "For once we'll have all the trout we
can eat."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Black," returned the man, in
his leisurely, indifferent way, "I'm sorry for
you; but I guess you'll have to ride to Lakeville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in my buckboard to-night. I'm the game
warden; and fifty fish is the limit."</p>

<p>"The game warden!" gasped Mabel.</p>

<p>"The game warden!" gasped Henrietta.</p>

<p>"The game warden!" gasped all the others.</p>

<p>"The penalty," drawled the leisurely officer,
"is either imprisonment or a fine&mdash;seein' it's
you, you'll probably have to pay a fine."</p>

<p>"I <i>will!</i>" exclaimed Mr. Black. "What's
that about a limit? I didn't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"New law," explained the man, lazily.
"And some of these here trout that your kids
have caught are undersized; they ain't seven
inches&mdash;'nother new law; you'll have to pay
for those, too."</p>

<p>"Why, the limit is <i>six</i> inches."</p>

<p>"Used to be, ain't any more," returned the
placid person, fumbling in his pocket for a
battered copy of the game laws. "See, here's
what it says."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," admitted Mr. Black,
scanning the pages.</p>

<p>"I'm real sorry," stated the game warden
for the second time. "But you see, Mr. Black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
I've got to arrest <i>somebody</i> this week or they'll
think I'm not earning my salary. And I guess
you can stand it lots better'n some."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Black, "I certainly supposed
I was a law-abiding citizen; but I'm
willing to pay the piper&mdash;it isn't often that I
dance to such a merry tune. Those fish are
worth any fine that I shall have to pay. I'll
go down with you to-night if you'll tell me
where to meet you; but I'm going to eat my
share of those fish first&mdash;I assure you of that!"</p>

<p>Mabel, who had edged closer to the game
warden, now relieved her mind.</p>

<p>"Say," she queried, "you won't put him in
jail, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not if he's able to pay his fine," smiled
the stout officer.</p>

<p>"Where," she next demanded, severely,
"are your leggings?"</p>

<p>"Leggings!" exclaimed the puzzled man.
"Why! They don't make any big enough to
go round my fatted calves."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you <i>are</i> the game warden,"
declared Mabel. "You're just pretending."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The complacent officer, however, proved his
right to the title by showing certain documents
to Mr. Black. But, as Mabel leaned closer to
inspect them, too, her weight upon the rotten
log on which the bulky game warden sat
proved too much for the time-worn timber.
Down it crashed, taking Mabel and the astonished
officer with it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the water at this point was sufficiently
deep to break their fall, for the river
bottom near the bridge was of solid sandstone,
and therefore pretty hard. Dave plunged in
after Mabel, but permitted the gasping game
warden to flounder out by himself. By way
of atonement, Mr. Black invited the victim
to supper and later loaned him some dry clothing.
After this accident, the campers, somewhat
subdued but fully alive to the wonderful
charm of the day, proceeded toward home. It
was five o'clock when the castaways, hungry
but otherwise none the worse for their long
day in the river, finally reached Pete's Patch;
for the point in the pretty stream that was
only three-quarters of a mile away by land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was almost a day's journey by water, owing
to the numerous twists and turns of the winding
river that was so like Dave's queer conscience.</p>

<p>"Say, M'sieu Black," said Dave, lingering
after the others had turned toward camp, and
speaking in a dreadful whisper very close to
Mr. Black's ear. "Ah'm good frien' to you.
Eet ees ver' bad, Ah'm tole (here Dave's black
eye glittered humorously), to broke dose game
law; but eef you ees weesh for hide you'self,
me, Ah'm show you som' pooty good plass.
Dose game ward' hunt for feefty year biffore
she ees fin' dose ol' Pete Black. Hey, Pete?
You lak for hide on yourself?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dave," returned Mr. Black,
"but I guess I'd better take my medicine like
a man&mdash;a man doesn't hide."</p>

<p>His first plan failing, Dave kindly offered
to set the game warden hopelessly astray, to
steal his horse, and finally, as a last resort,
to murder the unsuspecting officer in a variety
of ingenious ways. But Mr. Black declined
all these kindly offers and finally convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Dave that he didn't mind going to Lakeville,
with a good fish supper inside of him.</p>

<p>The castaways found Mr. Saunders in possession
of the camp at Pete's Patch. He had
whittled a shingle doll for Rosa Marie, who
sat in rapt devotion at his feet.</p>

<p>"She hasn't taken her eyes off me since I
arrived, three hours ago," declared Saunders,
rising to hand some papers to Mr. Black.
"She's immensely taken with either my auburn
hair or my new tan shoes&mdash;I don't know which.
I didn't know, Mr. Black, what you wanted
done about this insurance matter, so I brought
the letters to you."</p>

<p>"Mighty glad to see you," returned Mr.
Black, "for I'm going to town to-night.
You'll have to stay here till I get back and be
a father to my family. I'm under arrest for
breaking the game laws&mdash;but wait till you see
what I broke 'em with. Those fish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Any news from Pittsburg?" interrupted
Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p>"Not a word. But I've brought letters for
all those girls. Their mothers, aunts, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
forth want to know how they're going to get
them ready to go away to school next fall if
you keep them in the woods all summer. They
want to make clothes for them."</p>

<p>"It isn't polite," giggled lively Henrietta,
"to answer letters the moment you get them.
And anyhow, who wants clothes?"</p>

<p>"There's just one thing that we do want,"
said Mrs. Crane, "and that's news for our
Billy-boy. He's so uneasy that he can't rest.
In fact, we're <i>all</i> uneasy&mdash;in a state of suspense&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mr. Black, "worrying
won't hurry matters, so you'd better amuse
yourselves with other things&mdash;perhaps Saunders
will help."</p>

<p>Saunders <i>did</i> help; nevertheless, it was hard
to wait; for by this time Laddie-Billy was
quite certain that he was a friendless waif, a
homeless orphan, or, at best, a hopelessly lost
youngster with only half a mind.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be dead," mourned Billy, bitterly,
"than a blithering idiot."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>In Fairyland</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MR. BLACK, hearing nothing from Billy's
people and knowing that Saunders was
an able guard for his precious family, remained
away for three days; for he found a
number of matters in Lakeville that claimed his
attention. He paid his fine cheerfully, and declared
ever afterwards that the day's sport
was worth all that it had cost him.</p>

<p>Mr. Saunders proved a most delightful companion,
in spite of his misfit clothing; for the
tall, slender young man had borrowed stout
Mr. Black's camping costume. Wherever he
went he was followed by devoted Billy and
the no less devoted girls. Dave liked him, too.
Even Rosa Marie waddled at his heels and
grunted happily when he condescended to pat
her black head or her fat brown hands. It
may have been his undeniably red hair that
charmed Rosa Marie, but it was his voice that
pleased the girls; for he proved a decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
eloquent person. He told them the most wonderful
of fairy tales, recited miles and miles
of nonsense rhymes and several yards, as Bettie
said, of real poetry.</p>

<p>But the fairy tales pleased them most because
there were so many spots near Pete's
Patch that seemed just like little bits of Fairyland;
and sometimes Saunders' tales were cleverly
fitted to these suitable surroundings. Before
the three days were over, the girls were
living in a veritable land of enchantment and
went about with such dreamy eyes that Mrs.
Crane was certain that they were all bewitched.</p>

<p>On the last forenoon of the useful young
man's visit, Mabel, pursuing a startled brown
rabbit, happened to stumble into the very heart
of Fairyland. The rabbit led her out of Pete's
Patch, through thicket and marsh, to an unsuspected
bayou&mdash;a little bay that had once been
part of the lively river but was now merely
a quiet pond. Mabel found herself on the
very muddy edge of a wide circular basin that
was bigger than it looked. The banks were
a tangled, seemingly impenetrable mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
green foliage, showing occasionally the vivid
pink of a late wild rose or the dazzling white
of Queen Anne's lace and meadow-sweet.
More inviting than all were quantities of
strange water flowers of shining white that
spangled the glinting surface of the pond.
These were new to Mabel and all hers for the
gathering.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the little girl, quite overcome
with the surprising beauty of this hitherto
undiscovered treasure, "I guess I've found the
Witch's Pool where the pale Princess was
turned into a&mdash;Oh! I <i>must</i> get those flowers
for Mrs. Crane; she'd <i>love</i> 'em."</p>

<p>A long, partly submerged log extended toward
the center of the pond. Mabel very cautiously
at first, then with more confidence,
trusted her weight to this. If she could reach
just one of those elusive flowers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a horrible "giving way"
under her feet. She clutched wildly at unsubstantial
air; there was a wild shriek followed
by a violent splash. Millions of golden bubbles
floated to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long moment that was all that the
brown rabbit, safe among the ferns, could see.
Then, a dozen feet away from the broken
log, a queer green object, a most unpleasant-looking
object, caught at the slimy branches of
a water-logged, barkless tree that had stood
in the pool for goodness only knows how many
years; and, freeing one wet hand, wiped a
veil of emerald slime from its mouth and eyes.
The green object was Mabel; and tumbling
right into Fairyland was not an entirely pleasant
process.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a few short stumps of branches
still remained firmly attached to the upright
trunk. The plump "Princess" was able, happily,
to find a firm foothold on one of these.
Then, with her knees under water, her arms
clasped about the slippery tree trunk, she stood
more or less securely anchored in the treacherous
pool, looking not unlike a green marble
statue in the center of a fountain. Fortunately
the water was not at all cold. Fortunately, too,
it harbored none of the horrible things that
Mabel imagined might be lurking beneath its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
verdant surface. It was because of her fear
of possible&mdash;or rather impossible&mdash;alligators,
snakes, and hippopotami that the little girl's
voice proved unusually feeble when she attempted
to shout for the help that she so sorely
needed. At any rate, no one responded.</p>

<p>Although the wonderfully tinted bayou was
a lovely spot to look at, with its green and
golden browns in the sunlight, its deep sepia
tones in the shadows, and its marvelous reflections
of objects along the edge, poor Mabel
found it hard to be compelled to gaze at it
for so long a time. After the first half-hour,
even with blue king-fishers and many-hued
dragon-flies darting down after water bugs, or
lightly skimming the jeweled surface, it seemed
a lonely place. As for the frostlike blossoms
that had lured her into the pool Mabel no
longer admired them; and she hated the brown
rabbit.</p>

<p>When noon arrived without bringing always
hungry Mabel back to Pete's Patch&mdash;never before
had she missed a meal&mdash;the other campers
began to grow alarmed. By two o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the entire camp was scouring forest, lakeshore,
and river banks for Mabel or traces of Mabel.
Mr. Saunders had even loaded Mr. Black's gun
and was firing it, at intervals, thus providing
Mabel with a new cause for alarm, since she
didn't know that the gun was pointed toward
the open lake. Laddie was searching the rocks
at Barclay's Point, Jean and Henrietta were
examining the roads that Mabel sometimes explored
for mushrooms, Dave and Marjory were
following all the more or less familiar trails.</p>

<p>"She's fallen in, somewhere," declared Mrs.
Crane, pale with anxiety, "and is drowned.
Nothing else would have kept her away from
lunch."</p>

<p>"And she can't get near water <i>without</i> falling
in," agreed Bettie. "But, so far, she's
always gotten out again."</p>

<p>Sometimes the hateful brown rabbit, safe on
dry land, bobbed up to look at Mabel. Sometimes
a saucy squirrel ran along an overhanging
branch to scold loudly at the little girl.
Once a big mud-hen waded into sight, then,
suddenly discovering the discouraged "Princess,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
fled with an alarmed&mdash;and alarming
squawk.</p>

<p>"I suppose," groaned Mabel, "I'm missing
a million things. Most likely Mr. Black is
back with splendid news for Billy&mdash;I'm sure
he'll turn out to be somebody perfectly grand,
like a young duke or the only son of a mayor.
Or Mr. Saunders is telling that loveliest-of-all
fairy tale that he promised to save for the
very last. And I <i>know</i> they'll eat every crumb
of those splendid huckleberry pies that Mrs.
Crane was making when I left camp. And,
oh! What'll I do when it gets dark?"</p>

<p>But Mabel, happily, was spared this last
horror. At three o'clock Mahjigeezigoqua,
Rosa Marie's really beautiful mother, parted
the branches that fringed the pool and peered
at the strange object upright in the water.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried weary Mabel, in sudden excitement,
"do come and get me&mdash;a rope, a
boat, anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you hol' on som' more?" demanded
the young woman, testing the ground with a
cautious foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried Mabel, almost letting go
in her joy. "Only please save me soon&mdash;I'm
awfully tired of this place&mdash;I've been here for
<i>years</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah'll breeng ma brodder," promised the
dusky beauty, slipping noiselessly away.</p>

<p>It seemed another year before Dave finally
came, bounding like a deer through the thicket,
with his sister at his heels. Dave plunged in&mdash;he
had learned by this time exactly how to
rescue Mabel from all sorts of watery graves&mdash;and
soon that relieved young person was safe
on some very black, oozy mud that, ordinarily,
wouldn't have seemed so pleasant underfoot.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing when this frequently
cast away castaway, still well besmeared
with green slime, was escorted by
Dave and his pretty sister to Pete's Patch.</p>

<p>"Geeve her som' bat' hon de lake," advised
Dave, before disappearing in search of certain
herbs for which he had found a use.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane, feeling that Mabel had been sufficiently
punished for her thoughtlessness without
being scolded, hastily prepared a hot meal&mdash;after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
all, she <i>had</i> saved Mabel's share of the
pie. Then, while Mrs. Crane was setting a
place for her, the culprit, escorted to the lake
by Jean and Henrietta, was thoroughly
scrubbed, rubbed dry, and hustled into clean
clothing.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" cried Mrs. Crane, "or the stew
will get cold again."</p>

<p>Just as Mabel was opening her mouth for
the first delicious bite, a brown, sinewy hand
deftly placed a dingy tin cup at her lips, her
head was unexpectedly twitched backward, and
before Mabel could realize what was happening,
Dave had poured a generous dose of his
evil-smelling herb tea down her unresisting
throat.</p>

<p>"Ah'm learn dose good trick off ma gran'modder,"
explained Dave, evidently much
elated at his success. "Ma gran'modder ver'
smart ol' squaw."</p>

<p>"I wish," choked Mabel, crimson with indignation,
"your horrid old grandmother 'd
never been <i>born</i>."</p>

<p>"Som' tam'," smiled Dave, sympathetically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
"Ah'm used for weesh dat, too. But dose
medicine ees ver' good&mdash;mak' you feel all bully
hon top your inside, bam-bye. Maybe you lak'
som' more, hey?"</p>

<p>"You go home!" snapped Mabel. "I'll
taste that stuff for a <i>year</i>."</p>

<p>Dave chuckled as he slipped away. And,
however dreadful it looked and smelled and
tasted, the medicine at any rate did no harm;
for Mabel awoke next morning none the worse
for either the prolonged soaking, Dave's unpalatable
remedy, or even an unusually large
portion of Mrs. Crane's famous pie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>A Visitor for Laddie</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE campers had barely finished breakfast
when Captain Berry's launch chug-chugged
into the little harbor; and the girls,
still at the table, were laughing so heartily over
one of Mr. Saunders' amusing tales that they
had no suspicion of the launch's presence, at
that unusual hour, until Mr. Black's hearty
"Hi there, folks! Isn't anybody up?" made
them all jump.</p>

<p>"Oh," breathed Mabel, evidently much relieved.
"They didn't put him in prison, after
all."</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better be getting into my own
clothes," said Saunders. "I'll be going back
with Captain Berry, I suppose. I'd <i>much</i>
rather stay."</p>

<p>"There's no need for you to hurry," returned
Mrs. Crane. "Captain Berry always
stops for quite awhile; so finish your breakfast
in peace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Black, now plainly visible from the open
door of the dining tent, was coming up the
path from the beach. Behind him walked another
person&mdash;a small woman in widow's garb.
Her thin, white face wore an anxious, strained
expression; her blue eyes beamed with eager
expectancy, her hands twitched.</p>

<p>As the pair approached all the campers regarded
them wonderingly. Suddenly Billy's
cup dropped with a crash. In another moment
he had leaped over the bench and was racing
down the pathway.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried. "Mother! It's my
mother!"</p>

<p>The little woman, laughing and crying together,
was seized by this big whirlwind of a
boy and hugged until she gasped for mercy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Laddie Lombard!" she cried. "I&mdash;I'm
so glad&mdash;Oh, do let me cry just a minute!
I thought&mdash;oh, <i>Laddie!</i>"</p>

<p>Saunders, with a delicacy that still further
endeared him to the adoring girls, silently
reached forth a long arm and dropped the tent
flap. Mr. Black, his kindly face beaming with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
sympathy, pushed his way in; Laddie, rather
close to tears himself, led his weeping mother
to a bench under the trees.</p>

<p>"Her name," explained Mr. Black, seating
himself at the breakfast table between Bettie
and Jean, "is Mrs. Tracy Lombard. She
wasn't in Pittsburg; but a friend of hers saw
the notice in the paper and telegraphed her,
and she came as fast as she could."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/i299.jpg" width="301" height="500" alt="Boy  hugging his mother" />
<div class="caption">"<span class="smcap">Mother!" he cried. "Mother! It's my mother!</span>"</div>
</div>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> she did," breathed Mrs. Crane.
"But how did the boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Billy&mdash;Laddie, I mean&mdash;wasn't well this
spring. It happened that he was coming down
with typhoid; but his mother didn't know that&mdash;thought
it was overwork in school. Hoping
to benefit him by a change of climate, Mrs.
Lombard, always rather fussy, I imagine, over
this one precious infant, started West with
him, over the Canadian Pacific route. She had
relatives in Seattle or Portland&mdash;I've forgotten
which. But that part of it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>"The second day after leaving Pittsburg,
Laddie became so alarmingly ill that Mrs.
Lombard was glad to accept the invitation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>a fellow-traveler, a motherly, middle-aged
woman, who lived in a small village on the
north shore of Lake Superior."</p>

<p>"In Canada?" queried Marjory.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Mr. Black. "In, as nearly
as I could make out from Mrs. Lombard's description,
a very quiet little place across the
lake from Pete's Patch, if not exactly opposite.
But so far away that one wouldn't expect small
boats to make the journey. In that village,
however, Laddie was seriously ill; because, by
this time, he had pneumonia in addition to
typhoid. For weeks he was a very sick boy.
Then, when he began to mend, his mother
found it difficult to hold him down, headstrong
little rascal that he was, with no father to control
him&mdash;his father died when Laddie was
two years old, and I guess the boy has had
his own way most of the time."</p>

<p>"He isn't a bit spoiled," defended Mrs.
Crane. "But go on with your story."</p>

<p>"Long before he was well enough to walk
he was begging to be taken on the water&mdash;he
was always crazy about the water, his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
says; perhaps because most of his ancestors
were sailors. On pleasant days&mdash;our spring
was unusually mild, you remember&mdash;they allowed
him to sit on the sunny veranda of Mrs.
Brown's cottage, from which the lake, only
two hundred feet distant, was plainly visible.
At first they merely rolled him up in a blanket;
but for the last three days of his sojourn in
that place he had worn his clothes, shoes and
all, since it galled his proud young spirit to
be considered an invalid in the sight of the
villagers.</p>

<p>"One day, during the half-hour or so that
Mrs. Lombard was busy changing her dress,
straightening her son's room, and so forth,
Laddie disappeared."</p>

<p>"Before he could walk?" demanded Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>"No, he was able to go from room to room
by that time. You've noticed, haven't you,
how quickly he recovers, once he is started?
Well, as soon as he was better he disappeared."</p>

<p>"Where did he go?" asked Bettie. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
girls, of course, were all nearly breathless with
interest&mdash;no tale told by Saunders had held
them so closely.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows," returned Mr. Black.
"Probably nobody ever <i>will</i> know precisely
what happened. However, there was a sociable
half-breed fisherman, sort of a half-witted
chap, who had leaned over the fence almost
daily to talk to the boy. The theory is that
he asked Laddie to go out in his boat. The
landing was only a short distance away and
almost directly in front of Mrs. Brown's house;
but, owing to jutting rocks at the east side of
the little bay, one could easily embark and
very speedily get entirely out of sight of any
of the houses. Now, the chances are that
Laddie, or any other boy, invited by Indian
Charlie to go out for a brief sail, would have
considered it rather smart to accept the invitation.
Would have thought it a good joke on
his mother, perhaps&mdash;the best of boys make
such mistakes, sometimes.</p>

<p>"Anyway, Laddie disappeared, and several
days later Indian Charlie was found drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
near a rocky point several miles from the village;
pieces of timber that <i>might</i> have been
part of his boat were picked up after the
storm&mdash;that same storm that brought Laddie
to us. Moreover, another fisherman remembered
noticing a boy with very bright hair in
Charlie's boat, which he happened to pass that
afternoon a mile or two down the shore. The
wind was pretty fresh that day, and by night
it was blowing a gale.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lombard was forced to conclude,
when no further word was heard of Laddie,
that her boy had shared poor Charlie's fate&mdash;several
far more seaworthy boats were wrecked
that night and more than one unfortunate
sailor lost his life. But Mrs. Lombard is now
blaming herself for giving up hope so easily,
though she did offer a reward, through the
Canadian papers, for the finding of Laddie's
body; and afterwards the Canadian shore was
searched quite thoroughly. It didn't occur to
anybody that Laddie, probably lashed to the
mast by Indian Charlie, probably ill again and
possibly delirious, as a result of exposure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
wind and waves, could have been carried across
Lake Superior in so frail a craft as that poor
half-breed's boat. But the wind was in the
right direction. How long the boat held together
we shall never know.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lombard learned afterwards that Indian
Charlie was considered far too reckless in
his handling of sailboats, and that he hadn't
any better judgment than to take a sick boy
out to sea if the boy showed the faintest inclination
to go&mdash;and you know how wild that
Billy-boy is about the water. Bless me, Sarah!
That poor woman wouldn't wait for any breakfast&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll make some fresh coffee this minute,"
said Mrs. Crane, "but do save the rest of the
story until I get back."</p>

<p>"There isn't any more," returned Mr. Black,
taking a drink of water, "except that Mrs.
Lombard reached town at four o'clock this
morning, routed me out at half-past&mdash;the advertisement
read 'apply to Peter Black'&mdash;and
we came here as fast as gasoline could bring
us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then <i>you</i> didn't have any breakfast,
either," guessed Mrs. Crane, shrewdly.</p>

<p>"I suspect I didn't," admitted Mr. Black.</p>

<p>And then Laddie Billy Blue-eyes, otherwise
William Tracy Lombard, introduced his pretty
little blond mother to all the campers.</p>

<p>"I'm remembering things so fast," said he,
"that it makes me dizzy. Mother seems to
be the missing link that connects me with Pittsburg
and everything else. You know I always
said that Dave reminded me of somebody?
Well, when mother spoke of Indian Charlie, I
<i>knew</i>. For a moment I could feel a boat heave
up and down; and in a flash I saw a dark face
something like Dave's, and some rather long,
very black hair, also like Dave's. I could see
the face <i>two</i> ways. Once it was laughing, over
a fence top. Then it was all twisted up with
fright&mdash;bending over me and scared blue. And
while the face looked like that, there were
hands fumbling about my waist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if," queried Bettie, "somebody were
tying a life-preserver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," declared Laddie. "And that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
dreadful face said things in a dreadful voice;
but I couldn't hear&mdash;everything whirled and
roared. Sometimes there was a horrible going-down
feeling. Perhaps, after all, I just
dreamed all that, but&mdash;but I <i>think</i> it happened."</p>

<p>"And you don't remember getting into any
boat?" asked Mrs. Lombard.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Laddie, whose always
responsive eyes twinkled suddenly. "But if
it were poor Charlie's fault, it wouldn't be polite
to remember; if it were mine, I'd rather
forget it; but I really don't remember one thing
about those days in Canada, except that face
like Dave's."</p>

<p>"No wonder," said Mrs. Lombard. "You
were delirious when we took you off the train
and so hazy when you were sitting up that you
didn't know whether you were in Oregon or
Pittsburg. You'd been <i>terribly</i> sick. The doctor
said that your splendid constitution was
all that saved you. And to think that you
survived that storm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" scoffed Billy, "that boat probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
lasted till I was tossed up on this shore. And
anyhow, a bath does a fellow good. See how
husky Mabel is&mdash;she's forever taking 'em.
Say! That girl would fall into an ink bottle,
if you left it uncorked&mdash;she just naturally
tumbles into things."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>Breaking Camp</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"GIRLS," said Mr. Black, when he had
finished his delayed breakfast, "I have
a very sorrowful confession to make. I've got
to lose you."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>," protested Mrs. Crane, "not so
soon."</p>

<p>"I don't like it myself, Sarah, but all those
mothers, grandmothers, and Aunty Janes came
and sat around my office and reminded me that
their precious girls were all going away to
school, told me that the school was <i>almost</i>
picked out&mdash;they've narrowed down to four&mdash;and
dragged from me a promise that I just
hated to make. As far as I can discover,
they've bought all the cloth in Lakeville, engaged
all the dressmakers, and are in a fever
to try things on. And I promised&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To send us all home?" guessed Bettie.</p>

<p>"Yes. A lot of men are coming this afternoon
with a tug and a big flat scow to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the Whale home&mdash;I suspect she'll have to go
to the factory for repairs. There'll be room
on the scow for us and all our belongings besides.
But cheer up. We won't need to start
until along toward night."</p>

<p>"So this is our last day," mourned Jean.</p>

<p>"Dear me," sighed Bettie, "we'll <i>never</i> have
so splendid a time again."</p>

<p>"We'll come again next summer," promised
Mr. Black, "unless you get so young-ladyfied
at your boarding school that you won't <i>want</i>
to camp."</p>

<p>"You just wait and see," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"No danger," declared Henrietta.</p>

<p>"But," mourned Mabel, "we won't have
any Billy Blue-eyes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll get wrecked again," consoled
Laddie, "and you can pick me up some more.
But you'll forget all about me before next
summer."</p>

<p>"I will not," contradicted Mabel. "I'm going
to write to you."</p>

<p>"That's good," declared Laddie; "let's <i>all</i>
write to each other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Lombard," offered Bettie, rather
shyly, "we've always wondered who Laddie
would turn out to be. When he asked for a
toothbrush we were quite sure that he was
a young duke, or a prince, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Mrs. Lombard, "he isn't
even a youthful millionaire. He's just a plain
boy. We have enough to live on, to be sure;
but after awhile Billy will have to work like
any other man for his living. I hope you're
not disappointed."</p>

<p>"No," said Mabel, magnanimously, "we'd
like him, just the same, even if he were just
a coal-heaver."</p>

<p>That last day was spent in visiting all the
spots that were dear to the young campers and
in showing many of them to Mrs. Lombard,
who proved a very pleasant little woman, even
if she did cling rather tightly to Laddie when
he suggested going out in the boat for a pail
of water.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Billy, "I can just as easily
<i>walk</i> out, if you consider that safer; but it's
rather drier to go by boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave, of course, had to hear all about Billy
Blue-eyes' experience.</p>

<p>"Ah'm have som' brudder Charlie wan
tam'," remarked Dave, thoughtfully. "Ah'm
scare for go out on som' boat wit' dose fellow
maself, w'en Ah'm leeve hon Canadaw."</p>

<p>"Do you think he <i>was</i> your brother?" pursued
Laddie.</p>

<p>"Ah don't know," returned Dave, who evidently
was not greatly concerned by the news
of a possible relative's death. "Me, Ah'm got
eight-nine brodder som' plass. Not moch good
hon herself, dose brodder, hey?"</p>

<p>But when Dave learned that the campers
were about to depart for Lakeville he was far
more distressed.</p>

<p>"Me, Ah'm find eet lonesom' widout dose
Jean, dose Margy, dose Mabelle, dose petite
Bet<i>tee</i>, dose good Mees Crane, dose good Pete
Black, dose fine Bil<i>lee</i>&mdash;maybe dose good dinnaire,
too."</p>

<p>Even numerous gifts of food, clothing, and
cooking utensils; even the bestowal of Terrible
Tim and Anthony Fitz-Hubert (the kitten was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
now so wild that only the half-breed could
catch him) did not serve to raise Dave's drooping
spirits. Although he assisted in breaking
camp, it was easy to see that he hated the task.
He sighed heavily as each tent fell.</p>

<p>The campers, already looking far ahead, as
happy children always do, toward new scenes
and new experiences, trooped merrily aboard
the big scow just at sunset that evening, eager
for the picnic supper that was to be eaten on
the deck of the safe, clumsy craft; eager, too,
though they did not realize it, for a sight of
home.</p>

<p>The evening was peaceful, the pale lake calm
and softly tinted like a big shining opal. The
homeward trip, with so much to relate at the
end of it to the dear home people, promised so
much enjoyment that no actual tears were shed
as the tug began slowly to move her heavy
burden seaward. Still, the backward glances
were sufficiently regretful; for Pete's Patch
was not a spot to be lightly deserted, and never
had the place seemed more beautiful than it
appeared now from the slowly departing boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave stood alone on the bank, for his sister
was already eagerly examining the ample store
of provisions left for their use. For as long
as they could see him, the girls waved to the
solitary watcher. But long after that Dave
strained his eyes after the boat that was carrying
away the dearest friends that he had ever
known.</p>

<p>"Ah'm lak' dose peop'," said Dave, with a
catch in his throat, as he turned away at last.
"Ver' moch, Ah'm lak' dose good peop'. Me,
Ah'm good frien' to hall dose; until Ah'm go
for die hon maself."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock that night the castaways
landed safely in Lakeville, and the picnic that
had lasted for weeks instead of hours and
proved so much more than a mere picnic was
at an end.</p>
